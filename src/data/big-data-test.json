      "Review": "In 2003 Tommy Wiseau made ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù with some help from his best friend, Greg Sestero.  In 2013 Greg Sestero wrote his memoir, entitled ‚ÄúThe Disaster Artist‚Äù which chronicled his life and the making of ‚ÄúThe Room.‚Äù  Now, in 2017 James Franco brings us the major motion picture ‚ÄúThe Disaster Artist‚Äù with James Franco himself playing the part of Tommy Wiseau, and Dave Franco (yes, James‚Äô real-life brother) playing the part of Greg Sestero.  And what a wonderful story they tell, I loved this movie. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt know anything about ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù (2003), it‚Äôs considered by some to be the worst movie ever made, but at the same time it‚Äôs incredibly fun to watch and brings a lot of joy to it‚Äôs fans.  It‚Äôs become a cult classic, with midnight showings all over the country where people yell out the lines as the characters say them.  Very much on the same status as ‚ÄúThe Rocky Horror Picture Show‚Äù (1975), it fails in such a spectacular way, that you can‚Äôt help but get drawn into it.   I‚Äôm not sure if I can fully recommend watching ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù from beginning to end, but at the very least, you should check out the highlights from the film on YouTube.  \n\nMany people thought ‚ÄúThe Disaster Artist‚Äù would only be about the making of ‚ÄúThe Room,‚Äù and revel in its most memorable moments.  But it is in fact, not that trivial.  James Franco goes above and beyond to give us a tale about friendship, pursuing your dreams and not listening to the doubters.  It‚Äôs actually pretty god damn inspirational and moving, on top of being hilarious throughout. \n\nWe see how Greg and Tommy met each other and why they became friends.  We see their early attempts to make it in Hollywood, which I‚Äôm sure any actor could relate to.  We see what led to the creation of ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù and all the craziness that went along with that, and believe me, there‚Äôs a lot of craziness.  The story itself is pretty unbelievable, but it‚Äôs actually very real.  Apparently, the biggest complaint during test screenings was the story was too hard to believe, which is ironic because it‚Äôs almost completely real.  Tommy Wiseau himself has said he approves of ‚Äú99.9%‚Äù of the film.  \n\nMaybe the most notable aspect of the film is James Franco‚Äôs performance as Tommy Wiseau.  The film could have very easily become a mockery of Wiseau and simply made him look like a crazy, stupid, incompetent fool.  But, to Franco‚Äôs credit, he brings a ton of depth and realness to the role and makes this character seem like a real person.  You immediately understand the way Tommy thinks and why he made all the decisions he made which led to the creation of ‚ÄúThe Room.‚Äù  It is impressive because anyone who has seen ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù would be baffled as to how that movie got made.  You‚Äôre able to relate to him and sympathize with his struggles along the way.  James Franco‚Äôs ability to humanize such a mythical man was quite impressive.  The real man, Tommy Wiseau is shrouded in mystery.  No one knows where he was born, how old he is or where all the money came from to make this movie.  Tommy Wiseau has a magnetic personality and so does James Franco in this role.  \n\n‚ÄúThe Disaster Artist‚Äù is one of my favorite films of 2017.  It brought me through a range of emotions and I really felt inspired by the end of it.  The end had my eyes watering up as I had completely lost myself in this film and I felt what Tommy Wiseau must‚Äôve felt on the day ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù premiered.  It‚Äôs a marvelous movie, the pacing is perfect, and I was sucked in from the beginning.  There‚Äôs so many great appearances from comedic actors you may know, namely Seth Rogan as the DP of ‚ÄúThe Room,‚Äù who had me laughing many times and a cameo from Zac Efron which floored me.   \"The Disaster Artist\" is really funny, endlessly quoteable (just like ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù) and it‚Äôs just a feel good movie.  I‚Äôll be watching this one again.",

      "Review": "<p>“Baby Driver” is the latest effort from Edgar Wright, the man who gave us fun, fast paced, funny films such as Ant-Man (2015) and famously worked with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost to make the Cornetto Trilogy: Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World&rsquo;s End (2013).</p><p>The film’s protagonist, “Baby,” is a top-notch get-away driver hired for robberies.  Perhaps, more notably, he is burdened with severe tinnitus, which he has had since childhood.  He blocks out the tinnitus by listening to music nearly every moment he’s awake, this gives reason and purpose to the film’s massive soundtrack, which drives the film in almost every scene.</p><p>Like many of Wright’s other films, Baby Driver is an action movie with a big heart, lots of laughs, and (in this case) as mentioned, a major theme of music.  I can’t remember ever seeing a movie incorporate music so well into it’s plot and editing.  The opening scene of Baby (doing the menial task of) picking up coffee becomes far more entertaining when he coordinates all his movements of his body and his car to the music.  The scene is reminiscent of the opening scene to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).  This set the tone for the film as something that will be action packed and foot-tappingly good.</p><p>Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx deliver particularly good performances, reminding us that they are capable of performing all sorts of roles with real depth to them. </p><p>In summary, Edgar Wright, once again, brings us a very stylish film that is interesting and exciting the whole way through. If you enjoyed Edgar Wright’s films in the past, you’re sure to enjoy this one.  The movie can be predictable at times, not every joke lands, and it’s not a film filled with a ton of symbolism and metaphors, but that doesn’t stop it from being excellent.</p>",

      "Review": "King Kong is a character born in cinema and became an undeniable part of film history.  With a character this legendary, there‚Äôs a lot of pressure to deliver something as big and bold as Kong himself.  Not only does King Kong get the proper treatment, but the adventure the characters take to get there is equally epic and helps to build the mythos of the beast.  Peter Jackson deliberately takes his time (over an hour) getting the characters to Skull Island (where Kong lives), but this pacing is expertly done and makes the reveal of Kong a major and impactful moment.  Jackson makes King Kong larger than life, he makes Kong a sympathetic character, and without any lines, he still showcases a range of emotion.\n\nThe story of King Kong is engrained in culture, you already know what‚Äôs going to happen.  Nevertheless, the journey is so exciting and well done, it doesn‚Äôt matter.  Our story takes place in 1933 New York City during the Great Depression, where Carl Denham (Jack Black) is a down on his luck filmmaker trying to make a film of ambiguous nature.  We eventually learn he has a map to the uncharted Skull Island and wants to film his movie there.  He enlists the help of Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to be his star, she‚Äôs a vaudeville actress who can‚Äôt find work during the depression, she is skeptical, but hesitantly accepts Denham‚Äôs offer.  On their voyage to Skull Island they‚Äôre accompanied by a large crew, including their screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brodey) and the head of the ship, Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann).   Even though he isn‚Äôt actually steering the ship, Denham appears to be running the show and has used questionably deceitful tactics to get everyone on board.  As you can imagine, they do eventually find King Kong (Andy Serkis, motion capture) among other creatures on the island.  I think we all know how this story ends, but journey to get there is satisfying to watch.\n\nAs we saw Peter Jackson do with the ‚ÄúLord of the Rings,‚Äù this is a very long film.  In fact, I watched the extended edition, which is even longer than the theatrical release and clocks in at 3 hours 20 minutes.  Obviously this is where I lot of people will decide not to watch.  You may be wondering if it really needs to be this long, and it doesn‚Äôt.  Maybe 45-60 minutes of the extended edition isn‚Äôt totally necessary, but once again, this film is an epic adventure, so I was okay with the extra footage because it helped define the world and aided in the suspense.  But at the same time, I didn‚Äôt watch this all in one sitting and I had to get up and move around a few times during the movie.  Let us never forget the amazingness of having the ability to pause our movies.  I know this is not a new innovation, but I will always appreciate it.  Peter Jackson doesn‚Äôt just fill this time with meaningless banter, he uses it define characters and build suspense.  Much like ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù (1975) and ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù (1979), we don‚Äôt get a clear view of the beast until we‚Äôre pretty deep into the movie.  He waits until your curiosity has peaked and it becomes a huge moment when you finally see King Kong, you might even get chills.\n\nThe character of King Kong, kind of reminds me of WALL-E from ‚ÄúWALL-E‚Äù (2008).  Both are the title character in the film and neither really says words, instead they rely on the director, animators and in Kong‚Äôs case, Andy Serkis, to create emotions within the character.  Somehow, even though they never say anything we can tell how they‚Äôre feeling with subtle expressions and gestures.  This is one way this film benefited from being made in 2005, as opposed to the (also respected) 1976 and 1933 versions of King Kong.  Much like Peter Jackson did with Gollum from Lord of the Rings, this is a completely CGI character we can empathize with and understand.  Through the eyes of Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), we see King Kong is not the monster everyone else sees.  It‚Äôs actually one of the more poetic elements of film, that there is beauty in even the biggest of brutes, sometimes people just aren‚Äôt looking for it.\n\nTwelves years after its release, to nobody‚Äôs surprise, some of the CGI hasn‚Äôt aged well.  It‚Äôs still totally passable, and Kong himself still looks amazing.  This is my ongoing issue with CGI in movies, it feels like they just won‚Äôt stand the test of time in the way practical effects do.  But in this case, it makes sense to take that approached since some of the battles are so intricate and long, I can‚Äôt imagine trying to do that with stop motion effects.  In fact, one of the battles here is one of the best CGI fight scenes I can remember seeing, it had me ohhing and ahhing for the entirety of the battle.  In its finest moments, ‚ÄúKing Kong‚Äù feels like one of the best epic films ever made.  The sound design, special effects and cinematography are brilliant.  It brought real emotion out of me in its big moments, and it was as exciting as the best action movies.  If you want an epic adventure, look no further",

      "Review": "More than any film I have reviewed thus far, this is a beautiful film.  Absolutely beautiful in every sense.  It‚Äôs poetic and layered with messages.  Just visually spectacular from beginning to end.  The director, Guillermo del Toro, is truly a visionary.  If you‚Äôve seen any of his films before, you‚Äôll recognize the style, which is truly his own.  Many critics are correctly reporting that this is his best film since ‚ÄúPan's Labyrinth‚Äù (2006), and just like ‚ÄúPan's Labyrinth,‚Äù he creates a world that is breathtaking in itself, giving great attention to the art direction and cinematography.  I can‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòfun‚Äô movie like ‚ÄúThe Disaster Artist‚Äù (2017) was, but it is wonderful and beautiful in it‚Äôs storytelling in every respect.\n\nThe story takes place during the cold war, in the early 60‚Äôs at Occam Aerospace Research Center in Baltimore.  Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a mute janitor at the facility which is overseen by the cruel Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon).  One day, a mysterious creature is brought to the facility with heavy security.   Elisa takes interest in this creature and the film follows their relationship.  The only people she can confide in are her co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and her neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), who delivers an amazing performance as an old man still struggling with his identity late in life.  \n\nMaybe the element of the film I was most impressed with from Guillermo del Toro, was his subtle storytelling.  There is barely any exposition in the film, instead del Toro subscribes to the ‚Äòshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äô formula.  All of the main characters feel well defined with their own shortcomings, desires and ambitions.  The story is loaded with symbolism, we see water as a recurring theme as it occupies the screen more and more as the story goes on.\n\nThe creature itself looks amazing.  It‚Äôs probably a mixture of CGI and practical effects, either way, it looked so real I felt like it was.  I almost thought that they had discovered a new species, kept it secret and used it to make this awesome movie.  Much like ‚ÄúKing Kong (2005), the film is dependent on this creature looking as life-like as possible, and this was accomplished.  The design of the creature was so real it never took me out of the viewing experience, except for a few moments where I was just amazed at how well it was put together.\n\nWe also see some spectacular acting from Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon.  Octavia Spencer is getting a Golden Globe nomination for her role, and despite how great of an actor she is, this performance wasn‚Äôt anything to write home about.  Michael Shannon is amazing at playing a psychopath, he is scary and scary good in his performance as the main antagonist.  Sally Hawkins performance is particularly praise-worthy because her character is mute and requires her to express many emotions with less tools at her disposal. \n\nI don‚Äôt have any major issues with the film, although there was a minor complaint I had.  What I didn‚Äôt understand was what made Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) so evil.  Although the performance was spectacular, he was almost a textbook bad guy who was really evil from the get-go, just ‚Äòcause.  As they plot ramps up, he is given some added motivation to fuel his madness.  But, at the beginning his character felt a little bit thinly developed.  \n\nThe story and the film itself is super profound and poetic throughout, which is the kind of movie the Academy likes.  Expect this to do well at the 2018 Oscars.  Even if you aren‚Äôt going to look at this film analytically, you can still enjoy the story at face-value, as it is exciting and suspenseful, even if it sort of takes the direction you expected.  ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù is beautiful in its visuals, its writing, its story and message.  Guillermo del Toro has further cemented himself as one of the great directors of our time.  Like Wes Anderson, or Quentin Tarantino, he has an unmistakable style and will influence filmmakers for years to come.\n\n92/100",

More than anything, \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" is so darn wacky.  It's a very long film at 3+ hours, and I can't say it flies by.  Still, it's undeniably a fun time and ends in a satisfying manner, in fact, the last scene is perfect.",

There were too many faceplam moments in the film for me to consider it great.  Also the cousin loving was weird.",

The soundtrack is perfect for the film and the acting is obviously top notch.  But the story was just odd and never really hit me hard.  It took a while to wrap my head around this and I get it, but I don't love it.  It's the kind of movie that as a film critic or film aficionado, you're supposed to love.  Don't feel guilty if you don't, this isn't \"There Will Be Blood\" (2007), we've seen better from DDL and PTA.  Someone called this a 'pretentious Fifty Shades of Grey' and that sounds about right.",

The story is exciting, well written, with beautiful set-pieces, cinematography and all-time great performances.

People have always told me about how good Jim Carrey acted in it, and even called it his best performance.  And, no lie, he's amazing here, but, it was Kate Winslet that really blew me away.\n\nWinslet gives us a character that is constantly going through a wide range of emotions, she is flawed, aware of it and always self conscious.  With subtle expressions she conveys all of this and makes Clementine Kruczynski feel like a person that I could have met at a party.  \n\nThe cinematography, art direction and VFX are jaw droppingly amazing and beautiful.  There are countless sequences in the film that are expertly painted with gorgeous, unique color pallets.  It's awesome because it creates fantasy scenes that tell stories in the way only movies can.\n\nThe script and message of the film are poetic as could be, and just generally creative.  In a way, memories are what keep people alive, at least in our minds.  Relationships are going to have good and bad times, but you should always look at the big picture when evaluating it, rather than the last altercation.  \n\nMore than anything, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" leaves you with a lot to reflect on.",

      "Review": "You could rate this anywhere between two stars and five stars, and I would understand.\n\nThe film and it‚Äôs concept are bold, brave and daring.  When the credits rolled, and the lights in the theater came on, I didn‚Äôt immediately feel a sense of satisfaction, in fact, I was confused.  This isn‚Äôt the kind of movie that wraps up neatly by the end and ties everything together in a nice package.  It‚Äôs the kind of film that you can‚Äôt stop thinking about the whole drive home and in the ensuing hours.  It‚Äôs the kind of movie you‚Äôll feel a strong desire to discuss and debate with your friends when it‚Äôs over, maybe for years to come.  It‚Äôs layered with symbolism and uses a lot of fresh ideas that have not been explored in the science fiction genre.  The director, Alex Garland, deserves a ton of credit for giving us this high-concept, intelligent, deep story.  His first film, ‚ÄúEx Machina‚Äù (2014) was praised for many of the same reasons, and with this follow up, he is showing the kind of great films he‚Äôll create in the future.\n\nI went into this screening blind, and I suggest you do the same, so I‚Äôll keep the details as minimal as possible.  The film follows Lena (Natalie Portman) who is an army veteran and a biologist.  Through a series of events I won‚Äôt spoil, she ends up at Area X.  Near Area X, there is an energy field dome of sorts, referred to as the Shimmer.  It‚Äôs never totally clear exactly what the Shimmer is, but by the end you might have some ideas.  The point is, they don‚Äôt know what it is, and those who have gone in aren‚Äôt coming back.  Lena, along with four others are tasked with going in and investigating.  From there, it‚Äôs thrilling, suspenseful and, at times, breath-taking.\n\nTo no one‚Äôs surprise, Natalie Portman gives an amazing performance, and was perfectly cast in this role.  The events that she witnesses and the moments she lives through would be emotionally jarring to anyone, and her acting perfectly reflects this.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, Oscar Issac and Gina Rodriguez also give fantastic performances as the supporting cast. \n\nI know it‚Äôs only a February release, but I won‚Äôt be surprised if this wins best visual effects at the 2019 Academy Awards.  The 2nd and 3rd act are filled with jaw-dropping effects, and stunning production design.  It‚Äôs not just the execution of the effects, but the creativity behind them.  The world they create within the Shimmer is so beautiful, scary and just crazy, in all the right ways.  After seeing ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù (2018) a week earlier, I can confidently say ‚ÄúAnnihilation‚Äù is much more visually stunning.  It‚Äôs all the more impressive considering ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù had quadruple the budget of ‚ÄúAnnihilation.‚Äù\n\nThe first two thirds of the film will have you on the edge of your seat, like a great sci-fi, horror, thriller, such as ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù (1979).  The final third will leave you thinking and wondering like a great sci-fi epic, such as ‚ÄúBlade Runner‚Äù (1982), which was the comparison I kept thinking about.  When I first saw ‚ÄúBlade Runner‚Äù I was confused and perplexed, but as time went on I understood what made it great and thought-provoking, which was exactly my experience with ‚ÄúAnnihilation.‚Äù  \n\nA lot of people aren‚Äôt going to like this film, and maybe even hate it, which I understand.  You never get a concrete explanation for everything that happens in the film.  Alex Garland designed it to be ambiguous and open to discussion and interpretation.  I have great admiration for the risks he took making this film.  It‚Äôs a film begging to be discussed, so if you see it too, reach out to me and let‚Äôs talk about it.",

      "Review": "This is the fourth film made by Denis Villeneuve I've seen.  Now, I can confirm what people have been saying, he is the next great director in Hollywood.  For nearly the entire two and a half hours of this film, I was on the edge of my seat.  It's a pure thriller, you're listening carefully to every word each character says, just to learn more about the story at hand. \n\nSo many great performances in this film, most of them emotionally charged, as the situation called for.  Many people point to Hugh Jackman's performance as the best, as his anger and madness is at an all time high.   But I was more amazed at Jake Gyllenhaal's acting, maybe because he was the character I could most identify with.  His explosive moments where fewer and far between, but really helped to emphasize the stress of the situations at hand.  Viola Davis and Paul Dano appear as minor characters, but their performances were great as well.\n\nBeautifully shot, written, directed and acted.  It's a very intense movie, and doesn't have many happy moments, but the thrills it brought made it worth the while.  This was close to getting five stars for me, but there were a few lingering minor plot-holes I couldn't help but notice.",

They draw parallels between the different characters with the scenery in clever ways.  It's kinda about cycles that pass down through generations for better or worse, and how to raise you kid properly.  The best performance to me was Dane DeHaan, I had only seen him in \"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\" (2017) before, and,  good god, he's so much better here.

      "Review": "There‚Äôs so much pressure on the filmmaker to follow up on a classic film like ‚ÄúBlade Runner.‚Äù  You need to respect the original while letting the film stand on its own.  You need to tie into the original without relying on it for the whole story.  You need to keep the tone of the original, but also be fresh, unique and modern.  It‚Äôs so, so, so hard to do all these and there‚Äôs countless examples of movies like this falling totally flat.  But director Denis Villeneuve, pulled this off in magnificent fashion and surprisingly surpassed my expectations.  I wouldn‚Äôt have expected this, but ‚ÄúBlade Runner 2049‚Ä≥ is easily one of the best films of the year.\n\nThe story picks up in the same alternate reality Los Angeles, this time in the year‚Ä¶ 2049.  Forty years after the original, replicants are improved and have been engineered to be integrated into society as slaves and servants.  One of these replicants, KD9-3.7, or simply ‚ÄòK‚Äô (Ryan Gosling), is a Nexus-9 model and works for the LAPD as a Blade Runner.  The filmmakers of ‚ÄúBlade Runner 2049‚Ä≥ specifically requested critics not to discuss the story of the film, so I won‚Äôt say much more.  Early in the film K retires a replicant who speaks of a miracle that would change the way the world thinks of replicants.  The key to this mystery is discovered in a box buried under a tree on that planet.  The only other thing I‚Äôll explain about the story (because it‚Äôs on the poster and trailer) is Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) makes an appearance, and the two blade runners meet each other.\n\nEvery character matters to the story and has a sense of depth to them.  You could do a deep character study of any of the five or six main characters.  And many of them (that last long enough) have a strong development as you see their own story arcs.  All of it centers around K though, as any good film noir or neo-noir would do.  His story arc is certainty the most interesting.  It‚Äôs impossible to explain without spoiling the whole movie, but when you see it, I think you‚Äôll appreciate what‚Äôs happening on screen.  His girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas) plays an interesting role as well, and she does a great job eliciting empathy from the audience.  Seeing Rick Deckard again was a great feeling.   His place and role in the film are perfectly done in unexpected ways.  K‚Äôs boss Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright) plays a stern but caring human being, whose character is expertly portrayed and written.  There are some appearances of  characters from the original which add nice tie-ins, but still fit the movie for anyone who hadn‚Äôt seen the original and doesn‚Äôt know who they are.\n\nThe cinematography and visuals overall are the best of the year.   Some of the best special effects and set designs I can remember seeing.  The environment created here is brilliant all around and continuously awe-inspiring.  I can foresee many screencaps from the film being printed onto posters and hung up around the world by film fans.  Evidently, this isn‚Äôt the type of movie that people are going to flock to see.  But it is the type of film to remain a classic for years to come.  \n\nI think the main reason this isn‚Äôt doing well at the box office is the running time (2 hrs. 43 min.).  For me personally, it was not a problem; I honestly would‚Äôve been okay if it went the full three hours.  I didn‚Äôt see this movie when it first came out, I heard most people thought it was great, but some people had issues with it and didn‚Äôt like it.  The slow pacing worked for me, but I can see why others might have issue with it.  It‚Äôs not the fast-paced action movie that people are used to these days.  It takes its time getting from scene to scene and letting that linger helps the film enormously.  The big reveals are very dramatic and I was hooked pretty early into the film.  The slow pacing builds and tension and helps makes the major moments feel impact.  ‚ÄúBlade Runner 2049‚Ä≥ showcases truly incredible direction from Dennis Vileneuve.\n\nAt the the risk of sounding pretentious, I‚Äôll say this is a really smart movie.  It‚Äôs meaningful and artistically beautiful in many ways.  The concepts are so thought provoking and like the original, they will be debated and discussed for years to come.  It‚Äôs a film that requires and encourages you to pay attention to every word of dialog and every detail.  This is just an excellent film in several ways.  Like many other great movies, I expect a second viewing to be even more insightful.  Blade Runner 2049 has a gorgeous and creative world, so much depth, great acting. memorable characters, memorable moments, and a brilliant story.",

      "Review": "Sherif Ali: Have you no fear, English?\nT.E. Lawrence: My fear is my concern.\n\nPerhaps no films is more deserving of being called EPIC than \"Lawrence of Arabia\".  The runtime clocks in at 3.5+ hours, and although it doesn't completely fly by, surprisingly it doesn't drag.  Last year I saw \"Dunkirk\" (2017) and when I walked out of the theater, I felt like I was just in a war.  When I finished \"Lawrence of Arabia\", I felt like I had been traveling through the desert for a long time.    The director, David Lean, does a great job conveying this feeling.  \n\nIt's kinda cliche, but this isn't a movie, it's an experience.  David Lean shows us the hopelessness one might feel traveling for days and days in the desert.  It's not all hopeless, on the flip side, one of the best scenes is seeing a long shot on the horizon in the empty desert, then we see a dot emerge that slowly turns into Lawrence as he moves closer.  \n\nThere's not a ton of dialog in the movie, but certainty enough to suffice.  Lean uses a lot of time to focus on showing the vast desert and the long travels our characters take.\n\nThe only thing that's hard to digest in the film is the blatant whitewashing that does not age well in 2018.  Otherwise, this film has aged amazingly well because it was filmed in 70mm and the filmmakers avoided using sets, electing to film on location.  I'll be watching this again one day.  It's really enjoyable, and not just from a critical perspective, as some may have thought.",

Their chemistry is super apparent and the scenes with the three of them (most of the movie) are when the film shines the brightest.  I am looking forward to their next project.",

      "Review": "Really not as bad as people make it out to be.  The biggest issue with the film is the entire climax (which is a pretty important part of any film).  From that dumb, illogical CGI'd airplane chase and through the entire sequence at the hotel, it just goes way over the top and stops making sense.   I thought the plot as a whole was fine, and I really enjoyed the set-pieces and filming locations in the first half of the film particularly.  \n\nThe ending is satisfying.  Daniel Craig's hair looks weird.  But, overall, it's a disappointing followup to the brilliance of Casino Royale.",

Chaplin's comedic delivery is masterful as he goes from cheering the kid on in the fight, to giving him pointers as a corner-man, to seeing him cower as the big brother of the other kid comes in and intimidates him.\n\nThis is just a wonderful work of art.

      "Review": "Genuinely a well made film.  It's easy to see why \"Game Over, Man\" went straight to Netflix, and \"Game Night\" got a theatrical release.  It's simply a much more polished movie.  It's very silly, rarely serious, but don't mistake that as it being stupid.  It's a pure comedy, which I do enjoy, it feels like there haven't been as many quality pure comedies in theaters recently.  \n\nIt's a good looking movie, like I said, very polished.  I loved the opening credits with all the game pieces falling.  I'm a big fan of intricate opening credits (e.g. James Bond movie), and I wish more movies did this.  the opening credits serve to set the mood and get you excited to watch the movie you‚Äôre about to watch.  It's an aspect of cinema that's been lost with time, it was a category at the first Academy Awards, but that didn't last long.\n\nThe whole cast turns in a great performance, especially from the two leads Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams), who have chemistry and help to keep the film relatively grounded.  I also really enjoyed Brooks (Kyle Chandler), Max‚Äôs brother, who is seemingly flawless and much more successful than Max.  Their sibling rivalry felt authentic and serves has a major plot point.  \n\nThe story revolves around a group of friends who love to play games (charades, scrabbles, pictionary etc..) and compete with one another.  When Brooks hosts game night for the first time, he wants to up the excitement with a murder mystery night, but quickly, things get more real than expected.  From that point on the film sorta becomes a mystery movie in itself, as we try to figure out what‚Äôs really happening.  \n\nThe writing is sharp and the storytelling goes beyond what is expected in a comedy.  It's hard to predict, and you will be curious to see what happens next, but I can't call it 'thrilling.'   Although I did appreciate the craftsmanship of the jokes, I didn't actually laugh all that much.  There definitely were a few good laughs, but honestly, the plot itself was more memorable than any joke, which maybe wasn't their goal.  I can easily recommend this, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be going for the rewatch any time soon because it never goes beyond being anything but a solid movie.  ",

The cinematography and editing are masterful, creating a unique tone and style to the film.  \n\nThe only flaws in the film I noticed was the lack of an emotional punch watching some characters die, maybe because we never got to know them well enough.

Steven Spielberg knows how to make all types of movies, but the big budget blockbuster adventure movie might be what he's most famous for.  And, good god, this is a fucking adventure.  It's the kind of movie you should see on the big screen, it's world is grand and vast, and it's certainly a spectacle.\n\nBut, it's flaws cannot be overlooked.  The story is pretty predictable and it's filled with cliche moments.  There's a ton of pop culture references, and that aspect of the film may divide people.  I can see some people being flooded with nostalgia and adoring this movie.  I can see other people saying these are bland and obvious pop culture references.  I'm kind of in the middle.  There are moments where I would breath a heavy sigh, but when it's awesome, it's really awesome.  \n\nI was really happy with how it all came together at the end.  Even though it's predictable, it's still satisfying to see and has a solid emotional punch. \n The climax of the movie was handled really well, and when \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" played during the final battle, it just clicked for me.  I know some people will say that's a generic song to pick, but within it's context it totally worked.\n\nOlivia Cooke gave the best performance.  After seeing her in \"Thoroughbreds\" (2018) and this, it really looks like she's on her way to being a star.\n\nJust go see this movie in theaters.  The story isn't the most compelling thing, but the VFX and spectacle of it all makes it worth the price of admission.",

There's not a lot of dialog and the storytelling (other than one exposition-filled scene) is very subtle.

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Gillian Flynn (Writer)\n\nNothing like a good ol' fashion, classic mystery movie.  That's what this is.  The first 5 minutes start innocent enough, before the \"what's going on\" question is dropped on you.  As the film progresses, you get some answers, and more questions.  And it's perfectly paced so that you're always engaged but never overwhelmed with information.  The MVP of this movie is the writing.  Not only is the story super compelling and will more than likely hook anyone in within the first few scenes, but the dialog is clever and poignant.  Gillian Flynn wrote the novel this is based on, and also wrote the screenplay.  Through her characters, she dispenses commentary on relationships and societies expectations of that.  \n\nI love when I'm watching a movie, and I care about what's going to happen scene-to-scene, but when I take a deeper look at the underlying text there's a lot to take in as well.  The whole 'cool girl' monologue felt super insightful as to what men look for in women they want to date, and relationships in general.  The first act is a much different film, as compared to the second act and the third act.  What you think a character represents or values is flipped in the middle of the movie, and that's a great credit to the writing.  A lot of credit goes to Rosamund Pike for her portrayal of Amy Dunne (the gone girl), who is a complex character and alters herself in many ways throughout the course of the movie.  Juggling these alterations, complexities, and showcasing feelings and motivations of the character in subtle ways is a great credit to her acting ability.  \n\nSome parts of the film are predictable, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of the storytelling.  It also makes me think what a great year 2014 was for movies when this is the 4th best film I saw from that year.",

It's a straight up horror/thriller with not much else to it. I wasn't able to find much deeper meaning, other than it's championing of love, family and togetherness. Most importantly it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and that's elevate your heart rate.\n\nIt's use of silence is pretty admirable as well. It creates a lot of tension with that alone, as I found myself getting irrationally angry at the people eating popcorn next to me, and the guy who was getting to his seat 20 minutes into the movie (who does that?).\n\nThe pacing is great and IT ENDS AT THE PERFECT MOMENT.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Mel Gibson (Actor)\n\nI thought about giving the MVP to M. Night Shyamalan, but he made a few questionable choices in the story.  Whereas Mel Gibson delivers an amazing performance throughout, leaving little room for criticism.  There's a bunch of scenes that rely on the actors to keep the film grounded and just make it work.  It felt like it was teetering between awful and brilliant most of the time, and a lesser actor would've made the whole thing really dumb.\n\nThere's a five star movie within \"Signs,\" but it's flaws are a slight bit too glaring to ever truly approach that.  Even though Joaquin Phoenix and Mel Gibson turn in brilliant performances, some of the other cast members don't reach this height, and it took me out of the viewing experience at moments.  \n\nSome plot points felt a little too convenient, and I get that a major theme of the movie is 'maybe there are no coincidences,' and that's cool in all, but there's a couple times it goes beyond any conceivable coincidence.  [SPOILER AHEAD] The most egregious of these, has to be seeing Graham Hess's (Mel Gibson) wife, Colleen (Patricia Kalember) pinned between a truck in a tree in such a way that the truck is holding her together, and she has just enough time to talk to her husband for one minutes before dying.  I mean, c'mon, how many times in human history has that situation occurred? My guess is never.  That could have easily been a scene of her life fading away while they ride in the back of an ambulance, and that would have been normal and fine.  To his credit, Mel Gibson, still kind of makes this scene work because he's just such a good actor. \n\nBeyond a few moments like that where I was left shaking my head, I really enjoyed the movie.  It all comes together at the end and does a good job marinating on the philosophy of miracles and chance.  In it's highest moments, this is one of the best films of the decade.  I'm thinking of the scene where Graham (Mel Gibson) and Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) are talking on the couch, real late at night, with the children asleep in front of them, whispering \"See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, that sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or, look at the question this way: Is it possible that there are no coincidences?\"  It's just a phenomenal scene, super captivating, poignant and profound.  If the whole film was like that, this would be getting a five star rating.\n\nIt feels like Shyamalan has some great ideas and concepts, but his execution isn't always there.  You can see the amazing filmmaker he can be in \"The Sixith Sense\" (1999) and \"Split\" (2016), but sometimes his lack of polish spiralizes out into shit chaos like \"The Last Airbender\" (2010).  I don't understand his process, but by the end, this film works because of it's concept and lead actors.  It's not as polished as I might have hoped, but it still easily held my attention and left me in good spirits.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Jacques Tati (Director)\n\nIf Charlie Chaplin grew up with sound in films, I imagine he'd make something like this.  \"Play Time\" has minimal dialog and does most of it's storytelling visually.  Like Chaplin, the body language and facial expressions of the actors helps convey the message at hand.  Also, like Chaplin, this is usually used for a comedic effect, giving us situations that are timeless comedy.  These jokes usually revolve around a misunderstanding between characters.\n\nThe laughs are there.  For me, they weren't the biggest laughs, but I was chuckling throughout.  Beyond that, it's just amazing what Jacques Tati was able to put together and craft in his magnum opus.  The sets were all built from the ground up to look like a whole city, the film took three years to make and a ton of money.  It nearly bankrupt Tati, as the film was a commercial failure and didn't gain notoriety until many years later.  \n\nJacques Tati is another guy, like Guillermo del Toro, who is a real visionary.  The only way a film like this gets made, is with a person like that.  He went so out of his way to produce some of these visual gags with these sets which are so elaborate.  He uses offices, department stores, showcase floor, buses, apartments, waiting rooms and dinning rooms usually with windows to show us the inside.  They serve as a message that we all live in little boxes, and just move from one box to another.  It's really clever in the way it delivers it's message. \n\nIt's the kind of movie you could have on at a party muted, and people would still be interested in what's happening and probably understand the context.  And although there are a few main characters, their storyarcs aren't the point of the movie.  It's cool cause you can just enjoy the movie from moment to moment, which is why I think it would work well at a party.  At the same time, this is the most noticeable flaw in the movie.\n\nSince the characters and their storyarcs don't totally matter, it's hard to be invested of the outcome, since there isn't really one.  It just examines a day in the life in the city.  I found myself entertained most of the time, but by the third act, it got kind of boring, simply because there were no stakes.  It's really a series of skits, and it's brilliant, but the fact there were no stakes to make me care holds it back from being perfect.",

      "Review": "As a huge fan of professional wrestling, I was highly anticipating this documentary.  A lot of the information here was not new to me, but it was still undeniably well presented.  What I enjoyed most was the archived footage of him at his estate in North Carolina, and seeing him as a young, slim man in France.  There were a great variety of interview subjects that knew him well, the most interesting to me were Tim White, Hulk Hogan and Vince McMahon.  I didn't know of Andre's close friendship with former WWE referee, Tim White, but you could tell he really did know Andre well.  Hulk Hogan actually came off humble, appreciative and caring for Andre.  Hogan owes a lot of credit for his success to Andre, and the documentary and Hogan himself did a great job conveying that.  Seeing Vince McMahon in an interview is somewhat rare to begin with, so seeing him talk honestly about his relationship with Andre felt really special.  \n\nOne of the most commendable aspects of the film is how well they explained Andre's importance to the development of wrestling and the WWE, going from the territory era into the national era.  He really was one of the most famous people in the world when he was alive, and his life was fascinating, amazing, mythical, and ultimately tragic and sad.  Seeing Tim White, Hulk Hogan and Vince McMahon talking about his death really did get me emotional.  This film tells his story so well.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Abbi Jacobson\n\n\"6 Balloons\" is undeniably sad, far from happy, not fun, but still compelling.  It's not the most depressing movie I've ever seen, but it's subject matter is heavy.  As the characters become stressed, so do you as the viewer.  You begin the feel the weight that they carry with them, as all you want is for them to feel relief.\n\nThe film is about a heroin addict, Seth (Dave Franco) and his supportive sister, Katie (Abbi Jacobson).  Katie seems to have a great life outside of her brother, she has cool friends, loving parents and a great boyfriend.  Seth's life is tough, he struggles with a heroin addiction, raising his two-year-old daughter, and maintaining a new job.  The films strongest aspect is it's ability to show all the terrible things that come with heroin addiction, and how it not only hurts it's users, but the people around them as well.  It's hard to watch Seth deal with intense withdrawals and the temptations of relapsing.  Most of the films takes place in the car with Katie, Seth and his two-year-old daughter.  The contrast of his daughter, in the backseat just being a care-free, ignorant, joyful kid, and Seth struggling in the front makes it all the more heartbreaking.  But the most poignant part of the film was seeing Katie repeatedly get dragged down by Seth's addiction.  She deserves to live her life, but still loves her brother and can't help but try to care for him.  \n\nThe ending worked for me, seeing Katie finally step away from Seth's failures, and no longer letting herself get dragged down by him.  It's not all sunshine and rainbows at the end, but it was taking that difficult step that finally allowed her to move closer to the happiness she deserved.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP:  Marc Webb (Director)\n\nNearly every romance film is a two way love story, of two people who fall in love with each other.  Simple enough.  \"(500) Days of Summer\" breaks the mold, and gives us (what ends up being) a one way love story.  Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel), and even though she tells him from the beginning that she doesn't want anything serious, he and us (the audience) believe the love will come and she will eventually fall deeply in love with him.  It never happens, maybe it was close to happening, but not really.  \n\nWhen it becomes apparent their relationship isn't going anywhere, as a defense mechanism, he starts to hate her.  It's painful to see.  He hates all the things he used to love about her because that's all he can do.  Summer doesn't deserve this, she was honest from the beginning, never led him on and never manipulated him.  It's one of those matter of fact situations, where no one did anything wrong, but someone is going to get hurt.  That's real.\n\nI love the style of the film, from the cinematography, to the costume design to the soundtrack.  The style helps to bring out the feelings of being in love and the despair of losing it. I was able to relate so many moments in the film to relationships in my past.  The highs and lows and intense stress that comes along with dating.  It's such a real and honest depiction of dating, in ways that Hollywood movies don't generally find exciting and largely ignore.  \n\nThe performances are marvelous from the two leads.  They felt so relatable, and their chemistry was so authentic.  I am Tom and I have fallen in love with Summer many times.  Just a brilliant film.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Kevin Feige (Producer)\n\nOh my god, I FUCKING LOVED THIS MOVIE!  I stress \"I\" in there, because this love stems heavily from subjectivity.  You should expect a lot of uses of \"I\" and \"me\" in this review, because that's the only way I can look at it.  I've been a fan of the MCU for the last ten years, ever since I saw \"Iron Man\" (2008) in theaters.  Since then, I've watched all 18 Marvel movies leading up to this.  After all that time, we finally get to see \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" the culmination of ten years of movies, and holy shit, it paid off big time.  Another element of subjectivity in this review was the amazing theater I was in.  People were cheering and reacting like this was the NBA Finals.  All the fan favorite heroes like Captain America and Spider-Man got huge ovations from the audience when they first popped on screen.  The hype going into the theater was seemingly unreachable, yet, somehow, it still surpassed my expectations.  I just had so much fun in that theater.\n\nIt's interesting that they told the story from the villain‚Äôs perspective, you could've called this \"Thanos: Infinity War\" and it would've made sense.  He's the best villain I've seen in any Marvel movie, easily.  You can understand his motivations, empathize with him and be in awe of his power all at the same time.  He's a complex character and brilliantly portrayed by Josh Brolin.  He's the glue that kept this movie together.  It seemed like an impossible task to balance all these heroes and their big personalities.  But, they did it, everyone got their story told, and got sufficient screen time.  They all played a purpose and never felt shoehorned in.  \n\nThe battle sequences were so damn epic.  I got chills multiple times, seeing all these characters fight with all their might.  That's a credit to the choreography, the VFX and the Russo Brothers.  There‚Äôs a lot of action, but it all felt necessary and was just so entertaining.  The film is visually spectacular, but that almost goes without saying. \n\nThe writing was awesome and filled with jokes throughout.  I was literally on the floor with laughter at moments.  I‚Äôd say 90% of the jokes landed for me, and even when they didn‚Äôt I still admired the attempt and thought they were clever.  It also did a great job not making jokes when the moment called for that.  That‚Äôs an issue with many superhero movies, like ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2‚Äù (2017), where a joke would undercut a serious moment, time after time.  But in this movie, the serious moments were able to effectively be emotional and impactful.  That ability to easily pivot between real and silly moments without being jarring helped the film flow super well.\n\nThe only criticism I can think of is, it‚Äôs not friendly to people who haven‚Äôt seen any previous MCU movies.  If this is your first MCU movie, I think you‚Äôd just think there are a lot of colorful characters on an adventure.  You just won‚Äôt appreciate a lot of the inside references to the larger story at hand.  But for MCU fans, it‚Äôs so satisfying.  I never got bored at any point.  The pacing was perfect, and even being two and half hours long, I was ready for it to go the full three hours.  That‚Äôs not to say the ending wasn‚Äôt good.  It was perfect.  My god, I loved this movie.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Catherine Keener (Actor)\n\nIt‚Äôs an indie movie about people making an indie movie.  It has low production values, as does the movie they‚Äôre making within the movie.  I bet a lot of filmmakers liked this because they could relate to what they were seeing, but for me, who‚Äôs just a fan of film, it didn‚Äôt have that effect.  It‚Äôs charming in a way and shows why making a film like this can be maddeningly frustrating for everyone involved.  \n\nThe humor didn‚Äôt always work for me, and I got kind of bored, especially in the first two acts.  The idea is each of the three acts is about a different scene they‚Äôre filming, and there‚Äôs always an issue that prevents them from getting the right take, whether it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs fault or out of their control.  This gimmick wore thin on me pretty quickly, as I found myself saying ‚Äúyeah, I get it.‚Äù  \n\nThe movie works because of the cast who are always entertaining, mainly Catherine Keener, Steve Buscemi and a brief appearance from Peter Dinklage.  I‚Äôm really not sure what I got from this movie, it was good, but I feel like I‚Äôll forget about it soon.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Vadim Yusov (Cinematography)\n\nI really think I‚Äôm just too stupid for this movie.  There were several moments where it seemed brilliant.  I‚Äôd catch moments of dialog that sounded like profound poetic philosophy.  The movie simply failed to pull me in, or maybe I failed to get pulled in.  \n\nIt‚Äôs super slow and methodically paced.  Some will look at this as great pacing that gives you time to reflect on the major questions the film poses.  Questions like ‚ÄúWhat makes us human?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat makes our experiences real?‚Äù ‚ÄúCan we be content with despair?‚Äù and many more.  Others will look at this slow pacing as simply boring.  And I won‚Äôt lie, I was getting very bored.  Maybe it was just too art-house for me.  I had to watch this movie in three sittings, because the boredom was putting me to sleep.  I would love to be in the former camp, and say that I loved the deliberately slow pacing and I rethink everything in life when it was over.  But this was not the case.  It did everything right as a movie, except holding my attention.  This may be one of those movies that I think more about as time goes on, and maybe I‚Äôll watch it again in a few years and revaluate it all.\n\nThe acting and cinematography were fantastic.  For being from 1972 it looks amazing, and not dated at all.  It seems like the Soviet response to ‚Äú2001: A Space Odyssey‚Äù (1968).  They have different stories but both were wildly innovative for the time.  ",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Vince Vaughn (Actor)\n\nThere‚Äôs so many movies out there that get boring by the third act.  It feels like I‚Äôve seen a bunch recently where it starts with an interesting concept, but it gets dry quickly and I stop caring.  It‚Äôs slightly rarer that a movie gets more interesting as it goes on, but ‚ÄúSwingers‚Äù is that movie.  I was doubtful at the beginning, it seemed cheesy and crude.  I was being overly critical of how unpolished it looked and the acting wasn‚Äôt the best.  But it grew on me as it went on.  It was charming, and actually had a heart to it.  Its situations are relatable, even if some aspect of the film didn‚Äôt totally age well (answering machines).  It really all came together by the end, and I was really happy with it.  \n\nThe low budget shows, but you can see the skill within there that helped make the career of many of the people involved.  The characters are great and hold the film together.  I related to Mike (Jon Favreau), I sympathized with him in his lowest points and cheered for him when it all came together.  Many of have known someone like Trent (Vince Vaughn), who has endless blind confidence for better or worse.  He always meant well so you could never hate him, even if he wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äònice guy.‚Äô  The dynamic between Mike and Trent is the soul this movie.  I see myself watching this again one day.\n",

Not saying it doesn't make sense, but humor just evolves over the decades, and it's hard for comedy to stand the test of time.   Marty Feldman as Igor delivered the most laughs for me.  His timing, facial expression, and body language just works so well.   It's a good enough story, and a decent concept.   Some of the female characters seem very thinly developed, but I guess that was par for the course at the time.  It's predictable, but that doesn't really matter in a comedy.   The ending is nice and I felt good about my time spent when it was over.",

Each time a new character was introduced it‚Äôs radically different from the last character you meet.  They all feel so unique; every major character ends up being memorable.

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Ryan Reynolds (Writer & Actor)\n\nI was honestly worried that after the intensely good time I had with ‚ÄúAvengers: Infinity War‚Äù I was going to be let down by the next movie I saw in theaters, especially the next superhero movie.  I mean, how could it compare to that?  But let me tell you, my good time during ‚ÄúDeadpool 2‚Äù was not impeded in the slightest.  There‚Äôs countless big laughs to be had, and yeah, it‚Äôs just one of those movies that‚Äôs a ton of fun.  It rarely takes itself seriously, and in the few moments it does, Ryan Reynolds acting skill keeps it grounded in those fleeting moments.  To reiterate, those moments are rare, which I‚Äôm fine with because that‚Äôs the tone of the film.  However, for better or worse, the film is all about the comedy over substance.  I‚Äôm cool with it because I love the character of Deadpool.  He‚Äôs wise-cracking, fourth wall breaking, self-referencing and loaded with zingers.  I could see other people getting annoyed at this, but for me it works.  It‚Äôs a lot of action, comedy and CGI, and it‚Äôs all awesome.  When you're in the right mood, there's nothing like a well-crafted big-budget CGI-loaded fight scene. \n\nRyan Reynolds is the easy MVP here because of his understanding and command of the title character.  He wrote of lot of the lines for Deadpool himself and that personality brings this movie to life.  There are a lot of new and interesting characters introduced here, my favorite being Domino and Vanisher.  Domino has an intriguing and unique superpower that was explored in a fun and interesting way. \n\nWhen you look deeper at the movie for anything profound it‚Äôs not really there, but that wasn‚Äôt what I wanted from the movie.  It was just trying to be fun from beginning to end and that was accomplished. \n",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Hayao Miyazaki\n\nThis is a straight up, classic adventure.  Nothing more, nothing less.  It‚Äôs a movie that goes down easy, it‚Äôs enjoyable, often predictable but that never stops the enjoyment.  It terms of the overall plot, it‚Äôs super basic and unambitious.  It‚Äôs about a guy who rescues a princess from a castle where she is being forced to marry a man she doesn‚Äôt want to and is being held captive, basically Super Mario Bros.  What makes the film remarkable is the polish and execution of it.  The animation is great for 1979, and you can see a glimmer of what would end up making Hayao Miyazaki the legend he is today.  The characters all feel different from one another and are likable (at least the ones who were meant to be), and really, it‚Äôs just delightful.\n\nAlso, why is the protagonist called \"Wolf\" in the English dub?  The whole time, I was like, \"when are we going to meet Lupin The Third?\"  Only to learn that the protagonist is Ars√®ne Lupin III, or is at least referred to as that in all the manga and in the Japanese version.  Did they think 'Ars√®ne Lupin III' would be too tough for English speaking audiences to understand,??  I mean, it's a cool name.  I just wish they actually called him Lupin in my version.   ",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: The beach itself\n\nAt first, I thought \"The Beach\" was all style over substance, and that is true to some degree.  However, this film genuinely tries to be a lot more than that, which becomes its own undoing.  Although I never read the book, I am sure it is amazing.  There were moments where the narrator speaks poetically about belonging, modern society, happiness and more, but all these moments are just moments.  The film always doubles back and tries to be something else, never committing to anything for too long.  One minute they‚Äôre trying to make jokes (which all fall flat) another moment it‚Äôs trying to be stylistics like a music video from 2000.  Then it tries to dispel commentary on living in modern culture.  The film shows that if there were just 30 of us living in a secluded place everything would be perfect, and maybe it would be.  It‚Äôs an interesting idea, and something I‚Äôve thought of before, but it‚Äôs presentation is not interesting.  The most I was engaged in the movie was seeing Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his two friends search for the island.  Once they got there, the plot became unnecessarily complex and disjointed.  I would enjoy it at moments then something would happen that just had me shaking my head.  Leo‚Äôs acting is a bit over the top at moments as well.  I could see someone saying this was their favorite movie if they saw it at the right time in their life and they connected with the style, but I am not that person.  Not a total waste of time, but undeniably problematic.",

Two BIG laughs, once with Eric Molson (Dave Franco) and Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle).  The other with Jenko (Channing Tatum) having a big revelation with Schmidt (Jonah Hill) in Captain Dickson‚Äôs (Ice Cube) office.  There are certainly a sprinkling of other laughs to be had throughout, but those had me howling.  \n\n‚Äú22 Jump Street‚Äù never takes itself too seriously and frequently pokes fun at itself for being a sequel with the same concept as the first.  I always love seeing a film that is self-aware, especially when it‚Äôs a comedy that can have fun with it.  My issues with the film come with certain plot elements being excessively convenient, like when Schmidt meets Maya (Amber Stevens) after leaving a frat party.  The plot is very predictable as well, but this isn‚Äôt a thriller, so I can't get that mad.  Sometimes it just felt like the filmmakers didn‚Äôt care how the story came together, which isn‚Äôt a big deal in a ridiculous comedy such as this, but it‚Äôs only a mild complaint.  \n\nAs far as being a sequel, this is a great one.  Although they do retread frequently, they poke fun as their selves for doing it, and it‚Äôs still different enough that it‚Äôs not bothersome.  ‚Äú22 Jump Street‚Äù is the kind of film that goes down smooth, it‚Äôs easy to watch and just a fun time.

I like seeing convoluted out-of-place puzzles get solved to move on to the next challenge.  It doesn't really make sense, but after all, this is based on a video game.  That might be the strongest aspect of the movie.  The action set pieces do a good job paying tribute to the video game, you feel like any of them could have been (or maybe they really were) in one of the Tomb Raider games. \n\nAll the lead actors put on good performances, some minor characters are less than stellar, but beyond all that, the film is quite problematic. The writing just is not good, in fact it‚Äôs terrible at many point in the film.  The dialog is so bland and hits so many clich√©s, I lost count of how many times I shook my head.  Although the action set pieces were good for the type of film this is, the action was not stylistically on point.  Some action scenes are almost cringey and reminded me of ‚ÄúCatwoman‚Äù (2004) in its worst moments.  The storytelling is not subtle, and just too ‚Äòon the nose‚Äô especially early on.  Although the story isn‚Äôt too predictable, nothing came close to shocking me.  Overall, it's filled with a lot of clich√©s but I'm into most of them, so it barely gets the pass from me.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP:  The Original High Noon\n\n‚ÄúOutland‚Äù is the kind of movie you might‚Äôve missed, but when it‚Äôs described to you, you couldn‚Äôt fathom it even existed and you‚Äôre intrigued on the premise alone.   The premise is ‚ÄòSean Connery in a High Noon remake, but it‚Äôs in space and all spacey.‚Äô  I know, you‚Äôre probably looking at Netflix to see if it‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs not, sorry, but, what I mean to say is, I liked this movie.  As I said, it‚Äôs basically a remake of ‚ÄúHigh Noon,‚Äù (1952)  almost exactly, pretty much every plot point draws direct parallels.  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that because 1) ‚ÄúHigh Noon‚Äù is a great movie with a great story and 2) It being in space keeps it distinct enough that it remains compelling.  Although it never reaches the awesomeness that is ‚ÄúHigh Noon,‚Äù it still remains an enjoyable viewing experience \n\nThe film doesn‚Äôt age perfectly, because it relies heavily on technology, which is rarely predicted correctly.  Despite that, it still ages pretty well because the story and execution are good enough that it keeps the film engaging.  The thing that dates this movie the most is how they thought screens would look in the future.  They really thought we‚Äôd keep that low res green text shit, nope! People have dual 8k monitors out there.  It‚Äôs okay though, cause most people got that wrong. \n\nSomething to note, there‚Äôs also a moment where Sean Connery threatens to beat some sense into a woman, who later learns from this threat and becomes his friend.  But, for better or worse, that‚Äôs what you gotta expect from 20th Century Connery.  \n\nThe film started slow, and I actually almost abandoned it in the first 10 minutes, maybe because that last movie I saw was made in 2018 and it didn‚Äôt feel up to my visual standards, or maybe it just felt hacky early on.  Regardless, after ten minutes, it hooked me in and I was engaged.  The whole time I‚Äôm watching I had a familiar feeling all along.  I couldn‚Äôt quite remember every plot point of High Noon, but as the movie progressed those memories came back to me one at a time.  It‚Äôs far from spectacular, but it‚Äôs an easy watch and goes down smooth.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Stanley Kubrick\n\nOf course this film is hella innovative, and just spectacular, but it‚Äôs not perfect.  Maybe my issues with the film are more unique than other reviews, but it comes down to the film just not being accessible and smooth at all times.  For example, the opening is more confusing and strange than it needs to be.  Mostly, the monolith makes no sense upon first viewing.  I think Kubrick thought everyone would put it together that it had some sort of magical powers to kickstart new evolutionary developments.  I doubt that will be obvious to everyone upon first viewing.\n\nBut this movie is obviously amazing, everything going into this film is elite.  The music is elite, the set design is elite, the story is elite, cinematography is elite, the lighting is elite, the villain is one of the best to ever appear on screen, #elite.  The special effects are not only elite, but clearly the most innovative ever and hold up shockingly well 50 years later.  It‚Äôs just so clever how they did a lot of these effects.  The walking on the wall stuff was super clever, even though it had been done in movies many years prior.  The filmmakers were not only able to awe the audience with this effect, but also use it to showcase the effects of space and the savviness of the space station itself.  There were several points in the movie that I just thought to myself, ‚ÄòWow, this is a beautiful movie‚Äù  I mean the cinematography, style and color pallets are just magnificent.  The lighting is perfect.  Kubrick's use of reflections, colors, shadows, props and everything is just masterful.\n\nEarly on in the movie we see how spaceships and satellites can dance in space like a ballerina, as Strauss‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlue Danube Waltz‚Äù is played with shots of those spacecrafts roaming around the vastness of the galaxy.   It almost feels like Kubrick is giving us a space opera.\n\nIt would come as no surprise to hear this film ages spectacularly in most of its visuals and storytelling.  The only thing that doesn‚Äôt age well is the pacing, you could honestly cut 30 minutes of this film and it would progress more like a modern film.  The issue with the slow pacing and methodical nature of the film, is  it doesn‚Äôt always work.  When it does, it‚Äôs super suspenseful and profound.  But when it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just boring and seemingly pointless, mostly the art-house stuff. \n\nThere are few films that are this far ahead of their time.  If you were to show \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" to someone who didn‚Äôt know what it was, and asked when it was made; they might not think it was 2018, but I really could imagine them saying was from the 1990‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs also crazy to think that HAL 9000, the famous villain from the film isn‚Äôt even seen until an hour into the movie.  Kubrick spends a lot of time setting the tone and introducing the environment, and setting up many themes, notably that living in space can be a hollow existence.\n\nMy issue with the film is it just doesn‚Äôt go down smooth.  That‚Äôs what holds it back from being five stars, it doesn‚Äôt pass the test of being a compelling and engaging movie at all times.  Sometimes it feels like the movie is just trying to do things cause it can.  There‚Äôs ten minutes near the end that just looks like a windows screensaver with weird sound effects.  Even if its purposeful and a technical achievement, it‚Äôs not great storytelling.  Imagine if the last 20 pages of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' were just tie dyed paper, that would be ridiculous.  The film attempts to explain a lot of things symbolically which is sure to alienate a lot of viewers.  But if you study what this film did, you know it‚Äôs one of the most important films ever made.  Also this film has an intermission.  I like when films have an intermission, we need more of that.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Hannibal Buress \n\n‚ÄúTag‚Äù is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Its jokes don‚Äôt always land, in fact, I‚Äôd say most of them don‚Äôt, but they‚Äôre rarely cringe-worthy.  What carried the movie most for me was the uniqueness of the concept, it‚Äôs the kind of thing that‚Äôs just fun to watch.   Although the idea of grown adults playing a nation-wide game of tag is far from a serious idea, the film manages to stay grounded enough to remain compelling its entire runtime.  The cast is pretty strong beyond the five leads who all serve a purpose and bring something different to the table.  It‚Äôs never amazing, nothing really brings it beyond a solid comedy, but we don‚Äôt get enough of those tbh.\n\nThere might‚Äôve only been four or five big laughs, but I had a smile on my face nearly the whole way through.  What prepells this movie a step beyond average is its ability to bring real emotion in at least one or two moments.  I was already looking forward to rewatching this film in the middle of it, which is a reflection of how entertaining this film is. \n",

      "Review": "Movie MVP:  F. Murray Abraham\n\nI‚Äôm not even sure I realized how brilliant this movie was until two hours in.  I began to reflect on that fact I had been entranced the entire viewing up to that point, and I was greatly looking forward to the final hour.  ‚ÄúAmadeus‚Äù just does everything right and it‚Äôs a highly enjoyable viewing experience.  First off, you have to commend any three hour movie that can hold your attention the whole way through.  This ages spectacularly well, to the point when it ended I completely forgot it was from 1984.  The only very minor element that doesn‚Äôt age well, ironically, is the ageing makeup on F. Murray Abraham as an older Salieri.  The cinematography is beautiful, in conjunction with the authentic locations the film was shot at, makes this film a visual marvel.  The story, themes, writing and symbolism are so well done.  Salieri loves music so much that he knows how good Mozart is and knows how mediocre he really is, even if the average person can‚Äôt fully tell the difference.  Salieri is pure envy but also genuinely loves music so much that he can never deny the genius of Mozart‚Äôs music at any point.  This is the kind of film that‚Äôs enjoyable in the moment and when you reflect on it, it just further emphasizes how good the film really is.  \n\nThe use of the soundtrack might be the best I‚Äôve ever seen in any movie ever.  Music plays between inside Mozart's mind and out in the real world.  The filmmakers bring you inside his creative process and show off how good he was especially compared to his contemporaries.  \n\nMaybe my favorite scene in the film was seeing Salieri present a piece of music he had wrote for Mozart‚Äôs arrival.  Then seeing Mozart take one look at the piece, memorize it, laugh at its simplicity, then  play it himself, then improvise something ten times better on top of it.  It showcases how much better Mozart was than Salieri, even if Salieri was very talented and respected in his own right.  It also shows the beginning of Salieri's intense envy and disdain for Mozart‚Äôs effortless brilliance.  \n\nThis film made people become fans of classical music.  It‚Äôs just incredible and only becomes more amazing the more I think about it.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Spike Jonze (Writer & Director)\n\nThe easiest thing to observe about ‚ÄúHer‚Äù is the visual aesthetic is undeniably mesmerizing.  The color palette perfectly represents the melancholy feeling our protagonist feels, especially at the beginning.  The writing is also an easy A+, dispensing philosophy about love, belonging, technology, the human experience and so much more.  \n\nOnce again we are reminded how good of an actor Joaquin Phoenix is.  He carries this movie, not because the rest of the cast isn‚Äôt talented (they are) but because he has to.  The large of majority of the film shows his face on screen.  His emotions are subtle and sometimes he‚Äôs trying to hide them from Samantha or even himself.  It‚Äôs that ability that makes his acting so powerful, and tough to pull off.  I was able to empathize with him in those moments of loneliness when he‚Äôs by himself feeling misery, and in those moments of pure bliss where he finally found love that seem to fill a void inside him.\n\nThe concept is unlikely the first of it‚Äôs kind, but it‚Äôs done in a realistic way that made me reflect even more on where technology will take us in the not to distant future.  How will that affect relationships, love and human interaction going forward. The film never gets preachy, instead it just tells its story and lets you come to conclusions on your own.  It‚Äôs such a good film for the time.  I think this will be a time-capsule film that people look back at to understand the kind of thoughts, feelings and fears people had in regards to technology in the 2010's.\n\nI must admit it did lose my attention at some moments, but because it was bad.  Partially because I‚Äôm easily distracted, partially because there‚Äôs a lot of scenes that are dialog dense and partially because that much dialog can wear on a person.  That‚Äôs the only thing keeping this from five stars, it just wasn‚Äôt engaging 100% of the time.  Overall this movie is really beautiful and thoughtful, it leaves you with a lot to reflect on.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Ringo Starr\n\nMan, I love The Beatles, easily my favorite band of all time.  They were brilliant musicians, singers, songwriters and major trend setters.  They innovated and influenced more than almost any other artist or band in music history.  Beyond the legend of their music career, they also made a pretty good movie.  Despite being a fan for most of my life, I never got around to watching ‚ÄúA Hard Day‚Äôs Night‚Äù until now.\n\nThis film never approaches being a great movie, but it is pretty good.  It‚Äôs cheeky and cute with some nice bits of humor sprinkled throughout.  There‚Äôs just enough of a story to hold things together and that works, but I stayed comfortably seated the whole film, never coming close to the edge of my seat. \n\nWhat it showcases most is the fact these guys are all charming, charismatic, with decent acting chops and John Lennon is a good looking man at this age.  It also reinforced a fact I already knew, which is The Beatles were SO POPULAR.  No one (other than, maybe Michael Jackson) has reached the level of fame these guys had since then.  The film opens up with them being chased by hundreds of women, which is obviously fake in the film, but it was their real life at the same time.  They couldn‚Äôt go anywhere without being mobbed.  You also see the ravenous fans who watched them perform live.  It has been noted that The Beatles‚Äô concerts weren‚Äôt all that great, just because you couldn‚Äôt really hear anything over the screams from the fans. \n\nThe filmmakers also smartly included many musical performances.  In case the rest of the film wasn‚Äôt working for you, you can still enjoy hearing some of the great songs that made The Beatles the legends they are.\n\nAlso there was some talk of an orgy in the movie, which seemed‚Ä¶ strange.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Boots Riley (Writer & Director)\n\nTake a bit of \"Get Out\" (2017) and a bit of \"Idiocracy,\" (2006) then sprinkle some funk on top of it all, and you have ‚ÄúSorry to Bother You.‚Äù  The soundtrack itself is very funky, which is surely reminiscent of the director, Boots Riley.  He was a funk musician before becoming a filmmaker, and btw this is his first feature film.\n\nWhat makes this film so great is how it does so many little things right.  One example of this is how Cassius (LaKeith Stanfield) hangs a of photo of his Dad everywhere he goes, and sees his Dad‚Äôs expression in the photo change depending on his actions.  It not only pokes fun at that trope of looking back at your parents for inspiration, but also is a reflection of the film's mood at the moment.  All these small touches add up and give the film a ton of depth.  I found myself looking forward to rewatching this when I was only a third of the way into the movie.  This is the type of movie you'll want to rewatch to pick up on all the little details you missed, and even though I‚Äôve only seen it once, I think I‚Äôll pick up something new each time I see it.\n\nIt‚Äôs rare you see a new movie this unique.  It‚Äôs something that deserves to be applauded and keeps the film interesting the whole way through.  It‚Äôs style, presentation and story feel wholly original.  Just seeing the world these characters live in is fascinating.  It‚Äôs an alternative version of present-day Oakland where many stigmas of the real world are the same but the pieces are different.  I like how Boots Riley made a point of having no product placement at all in the film, everything in the film is replaced by a parody, which makes sense in this anti-capitalist film.   \n\nThe movie is, at times, almost too on the nose, but the film is self-aware of this.  Which makes it all work, still, I could see someone being unimpressed thinking ‚ÄúOkay, I get it, I see what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù  But the film never goes overboard in this respect, instead it comfortably walks that line.  Although I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a full on comedy, it is very funny but that never takes away from its ability to be poignant.  There‚Äôs a good balance of jokes and plot, which is a credit to the pacing.\n\nThe writing incorporates great commentary on race, capitalism, wealth, classism and corporate america. This is the kind of movie that is not only a perfect representation of many issues of our time, but it also seems like it will be timeless, as many of the messages touch on the core of society.\n\nI don‚Äôt always like it when a film replaces real events with metaphors, but this film does it so well.  There‚Äôs a constant trait of surrealism, which I loved.  Seeing Cassius (LaKeith Stanfield) and his desk drop into the room of the people he was calling kept the film interesting and titillating.  As the protagonist, LaKeith Stanfield gives this film the performance it deserves.  We see him slowly descend into madness, and his acting showcases this in such a convincing way that it keeps the film grounded even in its most absurd moments. It‚Äôs a colorful film with great visual aesthetics which makes it a pleasure to look at, in all respects.\n\nWithin the first 10 or 15 minutes of the film I was thinking to myself; this is on pace to be my favorite film of the year, if it can maintain this level of quality.  Lo and behold, it stayed at the level the whole way through, and goddamn it‚Äôs a great movie.",

      "Review": "MVP: Shirley MacLaine\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to see why ‚ÄúThe Apartment‚Äù is a classic.  I was hooked in the first 5 minutes and so curious to see where the story was going to go.  I was certain there was going to be a murder at some point, but there never was.  Billy Wilder was able to keep the film interesting without going that route.  The story is mostly based in reality, with some of the finer plot points being difficult to believe.  The story and writing are just so tight.  There aren't many, if any, plot holes, everything ties together so well.\n\nBilly Wilder was able to seamlessly give us a great blend of comedy, drama and suspense.  None of these elements noticeably dominates the tone of the film.  It leads to a pleasant viewing experience where I wanted to see what would happen next but also enjoyed each moment of the film.  I also respect how Billy Wilder was able to explore subject matter that was taboo for it‚Äôs time.  The kinds of themes and topics he explores here were not often seen in film.  This was still the time where we were all led to believe people stayed married and never cheated.  So you have to imagine the shock in 1960 of seeing a film present infidelity so casually.\n\nMy only issue with the film is that it suffers from some pacing issues in the middle, mainly the recovery process of Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) started to bore me after a while.  There‚Äôs enough compelling characters and plot points that it never completely lost my attention.  \n\nShirley MacLaine gives an amazing performance, much better than I could have hoped for.  Her performance has range and genuineness that elevated the film that much more.  It‚Äôs interesting because you almost see in this moment the change of acting style that was happening in Hollywood.  Shirley MacLaine‚Äôs performance versus Fred MacMurray‚Äôs performance is very much old school vs new school.  It also helps to further give juxtaposition to their characters who are already so different.  This in addition to the story and writing itself make the film a timeless classic. ",

Watching Easy-E slowly cough more and more throughout the film is heart-wrenching when you know how that story ends. I actually ended up crying more in this film than I have in a very long time.  Even thugs cry too.\n\nThe movie was so gangster, and reminds you how real the life these guys lived was, even after they made it big.

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Alfred Hitchcock \n\nOne thing many (if not all) of Hitchcock‚Äôs movies do is pull you in quickly.  North By Northwest was no different, after the first 10 minutes I was completely hooked in.  I just had so many questions; Who is this man really?  Is he who they say he is? Is this a mix up?  Is he denying it?  How can he prove it? This is what makes a story compelling and suspenseful; it keeps you guessing.  The film maintains this for the first half, but my attention faded in the second half as it became increasingly predictable. Maybe if I was in the theater in 1958 I would‚Äôve thought differently.  Seeing the climax on top of Mount Rushmore probably kept everyone on the edge of their seat.  After being jaded by 60 years of thrillers to come, the impact was slightly lost on me.  It‚Äôs one of those things where it feels cliche, but really it‚Äôs innovative.  But in this situation the run time got to me and by the last 20 minutes I was just ready for it to be over. \n\nIt‚Äôs easy to see the influence this film had on action thrillers for years to come.  There‚Äôs a lot of interesting locations and different action set-pieces.  So many movies after North By Northwest copied it, so it‚Äôs definitely getting some points for innovating.  There some great use of color as well, not as striking as Vertigo was the year before, but Hitchcock shows his dueling skills in the world of black & white and color.\n\nAlso it's just a bit racist.

      "Review": "Dragon Ball Z has always been pretty formulaic.  There‚Äôs a bad guy that needs to be defeated, and Goku and friends need to get more powerful to defeat said villain.  The power level turns up as the story goes on, and we‚Äôre all surprised by these new power levels that are reached.  I can‚Äôt say I was really expecting anything less than this, but somehow I was still mildly disappointed.  The story is just so standard, with very few if any unexpected twists or turns.  If you're not already a fan of Dragon Ball Z, then I don‚Äôt really know what this film has to offer.  The best moments are seeing characters I loved and remembered just kicking ass in epic fashion.  The writing is unmemorable and barely serviceable.\n\nAt the same time, this simple premise worked for me.  I got what I showed up for and it delivered what should be expected from Dragon Ball Z.  It lines up with all those superhero movies that I‚Äôve been loving these last few years.  Even when it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs still good because the action is always there.  I guess I just kind of hoped they would go above and beyond like we saw in ‚ÄúDragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods‚Äù (2013) which revitalized the franchise.  I‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm just content.  ",

      "Review": "This is the kind of film that really is for anyone and everyone.  Unless you just hate anime, you‚Äôll enjoy yourself.  Porco Rosso is a delightful and easily digestible movie that you can watch any time.  It has great subtle storytelling that goes beyond what you might expect from a movie like this.\n\nWhat I admire the most is its ability to be so wholesome without ever being cheesy, and it's still somehow gritty in moments.  It balances all these different characters, some of which feel like they shouldn‚Äôt be in the same movie.  I was so doubtful that this concept would work.  I mean, a pig who‚Äôs a fighter pilot mixed with a love story-- from that it sounds like a bland Disney B-Movie.  Nevertheless, I was hooked in almost immediately.  I love how Porco Rosso wasn‚Äôt a picture perfect hero, but he still had a strong moral standing.  \n\nEven though it‚Äôs fairly predictable, the enjoyment it brought me steered me away from getting hung up on that predictability.  \n",

      "Review": "When I think of Hong Kong action films, I think of two of my favorite filmmakers; Jackie Chan and Stephen Chow.  Both deliver fun and entertaining films with focus on crazy, clever action scenes and comedy.  On the other side of the fence is Wong Kar-wai.  This is the first film of his I‚Äôve seen, but (for me) it shed light on a different type of Hong Kong action film.  This type of film focuses on the storytelling, narrative and style.  ‚ÄúFallen Angels‚Äù tells two different stories that intertwine at brief moments.  In that sense it reminded me of Pulp Fiction but even more condensed.  This film is 96 minutes but it feels more like two hours, or more.  There‚Äôs a lot going on, the pacing is pretty fast and it‚Äôs just a dense movie.\n\nThe action scenes themselves were probably the biggest let down for me.  I was expecting them to be longer with more theatrics, but upon further reflection that was never meant to be the focus of the movie.  The style seemed very of its time, and reminded me of many other American films from the 90s I had seen.  Lots of blur, quick cuts and canted angles.  It‚Äôs a cool movie even if it wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting.  It‚Äôs themes have a lot to do with perspective, and how a situation looks from different viewpoints.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd pick up more on a second viewing.  It did make me want explore the rest of Wong Kar-wai‚Äôs filmography.",

      "Review": "There are too many clever ideas here to count.  It‚Äôs the kind of movie I should‚Äôve seen a long time ago, but for whatever reason it eluded me.  It‚Äôs a surrealist, dramatic, comedic, fantasy that deals with profound ideas in the silliest way.  It‚Äôs a sign of a great film when it‚Äôs able to bring you through several emotions and feelings seamlessly.   This was my experience with ‚ÄúBeing John Malkovich.‚Äù  There was tension, there was laughter and there was poetry.  Maybe most importantly, I was invested in the film early on and it held my attention the whole way through.  There was never a point where I thought I had the whole thing figured out, the film continually surprised me from beginning to end, and that‚Äôs rare.\n\nThe film makes such good use of it‚Äôs sets.  The fact their business is on floor 7¬Ω leads to many great visual gags in itself, in addition to the mythos it adds to the story.  Like I said, there‚Äôs so many good ideas in this film, enough for a dozen films.  It‚Äôs influence is easy to see on movies like ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù (2017), ‚ÄúEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind‚Äù (2004) which is done by the same writer and is an even better movie, and even in ‚ÄúInception‚Äù (2010) you can see the influence.  \n\nJohn Malkovich plays himself here to great effect.  He‚Äôs almost certainly the best actor in this film.  He has to juggle the personalities that are existing inside of him, and portray the stress and insanity that goes along with someone controlling your mind. \n\nMy only issue with the film is none of the characters are particularly admirable.  I found myself just observing the events as they happened rather than rooting for anyone's success.  Even the characters that aren‚Äôt evil or insane never offered enough for me to get behind them.",

      "Review": "This is another movie that eluded me for far too long.  It‚Äôs thoughtful modern science fiction, and beautifully shot.  It's the kind of movie that asks big questions, and gets philosophical in almost every scene.\n\nThe director, Alex Garland might be the next great director in Hollywood.  He‚Äôs made this film, which is already (arguably) a sci-fi classic, and more recently made ‚ÄúAnnihilation‚Äù (2018) which is one of my top films of the year so far.  He also helped write some other recent classics like ‚Äú28 Days Later‚Äù (2002).  So be on the lookout for that man in the years to come. \n\n‚ÄúEx Machina‚Äù is incredibly compelling and so well written.  It hooks you in quick and has enough twists that it‚Äôs never too predictable, even if some of the events can be telegraphed.  I had a few issues with small gaps in the story, and overly slow pacing at times, but overall it‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs hard to say anything about this film that hasn‚Äôt already been said, it‚Äôs incredible.  There‚Äôs so many movies about AI out there, so it‚Äôs tough to innovate or be memorable at this point.  But with some great performances, incredible dialog, gorgeous cinematography and super profound subject matter, ‚ÄúEx Machina‚Äù will be remembered as one of the decades best. \n",

      "Review": "Wow this is an amazing film.  I went into it expecting to just be taken on an adventure, but I got even more than I bargained for.  What I saw was an expertly written tale about greed, wealth, poverty, ownership, trust and money itself.  The film asks an age-old question, ‚Äúhow much money would it take for you to be satisfied.‚Äù  It‚Äôs a questions that is still relevant today, especially as the economic inequality in the world becomes more pronounced.  \n\nThe story is perfectly paced.   It stays interesting the whole way through, as the plot evolves and so do the characters.  You gain insights into each of the characters as more information is slowly revealed.  You‚Äôre never sure who you can trust, who‚Äôs honorable and who‚Äôs not.  \n\nIt‚Äôs a film that ages brilliantly because the story is so compelling.  I forgot this was a black and white film from the 1940s, and I was just sucked into this world and immediately felt invested in the characters.  There‚Äôs too many great performances in the film to discuss them all, but Humprey Bogart and Walter Houston are particularly good.  They both bring life to their characters where I was listening carefully to their every word.  \n\nThe scenery in the film feels like it was all filmed on location and helps it hold up well in the modern day.  It‚Äôs got everything you want in a movie; thrills, captivating performances, suspense, adventure, unpredictability and slick cinematography.  On top of all that, it just goes down smooth.  \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" is an easy watch and a great great movie.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Michael Pe√±a (Actor)\n\nDuring my viewing of Ant-Man 2 I found my brain in a constant battle between boredom and entertainment.  I was never bored long enough to hate this movie, but the fact I was bored multiple times is a reflection of the films weakness.  It was toying with me, in the sense that every time I was convinced I was going to give this movie a negative review, something funny would have me laughing loudly (usually Michael Pe√±a as Luis).  There would be moments where I was ready to give this a 2.5/5, but then some amazing action scene would happen on screen and I would perk up again.  The VFX were cleverly used and breathtaking at times, certainly much more than I was expecting from Ant-Man 2.  \n\nMaybe my favorite part of the first Ant-Man was Scott Lang‚Äôs (Paul Rudd) crew of criminal companions, who walk the line between being buffoons and reliable friends.  I found David Dastmalchian as Kurt to be underutilized in the first film, but here he has some moments to shine and delivered one of the biggest laughs of the film.   \n\nI also still love the relationship between Scott, his daughter, her mother, and her step-dad.  They have love and respect for one another, which is cool to see.  The usual thing in movies is to have a step-dad being an evil douchebag, but it‚Äôs nice to see that cliche turned on its head.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs super predictable and many of the jokes fall flat, but my intelligence was never insulted. Also, the whole Ava/Ghost character felt sorta shoehorned in and never really paid off for me.  It‚Äôs certainly one of the weaker MCU films, but I‚Äôm a sucker for them so this still gets a pass from me.",

      "Review": "Humprey Bogart would‚Äôve got #MeToo‚Äôd so hard if this film took place in 2018, but it didn‚Äôt, so let me judge it for what it is.  I love noir films, they‚Äôre all sorta the same, but somehow they still manage to keep me in suspense, the great ones at least.  I found the film compelling enough that I was engaged most of the time mostly due to the charisma of Humprey Bogart and Gloria Grahame.  The story itself is pretty well done, the twist felt pretty obvious to me, but that didn‚Äôt take away from it still being poignant.  The message being, the perception of someone being a monster can make them a true monster, especially when they weren‚Äôt an angel to begin with, in the case of Dixon.  It makes me think of all those news stories you read about; there's something horrible a person did, and even if they get acquitted, the damage to them may have already been done.\n\nMostly, this film reassured me Humprey Bogart is one of the great great legends of the screen.  He never transforms like a Daniel Day Lewis, but Bogart defined the style of acting for the time, and was the kind of thing most actors of the day shot for.  He was just so effortlessly charismatic.

      "Review": "I liked this movie, no doubt.  But let‚Äôs just get the problems with the film out of the way.  First, the filmmaking itself isn‚Äôt all that great, the cuts, editing and general presentation just felt off.  There‚Äôs a few awkward moments with transitions that just made the whole thing feel unpolished.  Secondly, many jokes fell flat, and not just with me, but the whole audience.  I saw these jokes set up and delivered, and no one was laughing, though these attempts were never insultingly bad.  That‚Äôs not to say there were no laughs, there was certainly scattered laughter throughout and a couple great jokes.\n\nWith that being said, I totally enjoyed myself.  For having a crazy plot there was a very real message.  I kind of expected this film to be a little more lighthearted.  Not to say that‚Äôs a problem, it‚Äôs not, in fact it serves as a reminder of the terrible racism in this country's past, which hasn‚Äôt been alleviated yet.  Spike Lee spends a lot of time comparing the Black Panthers and KKK.  He shows the juxtaposition of these two groups who are both proud of their heritage.  Lee doesn‚Äôt necessarily spend a lot of time painting one as being better than the other, even though the KKK are clearly much much worse people.  Instead, he focuses on the protagonist, the straight-edge, clean-cut, and black Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) who is in the middle of it all, and the moral center.  He works for the police department, which has racist cops and a few more reliable compassionate white cops who Ron can place some faith in.  Ron and his trustworthy partner, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) work undercover in both the KKK and the Black Panthers, which sheds light on the inter-workings of both.   It also gives insight to how the police approach both groups, which may be with a bit of bias.  The film can be a downer at times, but that's just it being real, so I wouldn't think to criticize it for that, as I have seen others do.\n\nI also recognize a lot of the film is fictionalized despite being told at the beginning it is \"fo real,\" that did not bother me.  \n\nThe film never veers away from dispensing social commentary, but it still manages to remain compelling through it all, and will more than likely leave you with something to think about.  Although ‚ÄúBlackkklsanman‚Äù never approaches the brilliance of Spike Lee‚Äôs top tier films, like ‚ÄúDo The Right Thing‚Äù (1989) it‚Äôs still a worthwhile use of two hours.",

Not to say it was a painful theater experience, I still had fun at the 10pm IMAX showing on Wednesday night, but I had fun despite the movie, not because of it.

The film tells the real story (I think) of Vincent Van Gogh‚Äôs death and the final weeks of his life.  It‚Äôs only right that the story is told after his death, because that is when the legend of Van Gogh grew strongest. \n\nAside from the great story, clearly the most notable and memorable aspect of ‚ÄúLoving Vincent‚Äù is the labor intensive, breath taking 65,000 frames of this film which were all hand painted by 125 painters.  It‚Äôs the kind of thing that won‚Äôt cease to amaze you.  At different times during the viewing, from beginning to end, you‚Äôll find yourself in awe of what you‚Äôre seeing on screen.

In that sense this film holds up super well.  \n\nIt‚Äôs also clearly a product of its time.  The film fully indulges into musical montages, and I enjoyed that wave of nostalgia.  Also, its few female characters are fairly one dimensional (despite a great performance from Glenne Headly as Tess Trueheart), I did not enjoy that wave of nostalgia as much. \n\nThe story in its essence is a nice tribute to noir films, though I did get bored at moments and found it somewhat predictable.

Once you‚Äôve done that, you‚Äôre on your way to an enjoyable viewing experience. \n\nThe cast is an eclectic group of people you may not be expecting, just look at the cast list if you don't already know.  This film is insane in all the best ways.  Despite giving this a 3/5 I highly recommend it.\n",

      "Review": "Very quickly, I fell in love with the style of this film.  It has a majestic beauty to all its design and presentation.  There‚Äôs a scene near the beginning that visually shows text messages spreading in such a clever and sleek manner.  After that I knew this was a style I could get behind.  You see it everywhere in the movie, from the wardrobe, to the varied color palettes, to the grand sets.  The cinematography is undeniably gorgeous.\n\nSo many memorable characters appear throughout the story.  At first I thought there were too many characters being thrown at me, it seemed some were bound to get lost in the shuffle.  By the end, to my surprise, I realized I remembered all of them.  The cast as a whole may be the best of the year.  Featuring well known and veteran actors, as well as some newcomers that will surely become stars after this.\n\nThere‚Äôs a huge theme of Old vs New in the story, we see these ideas clash and meld constantly.  Its overall plot isn‚Äôt very inventive, but the big moments of the film are well written.  It's also a ‚Äúromantic comedy‚Äù so you get a lot of jokes thrown your way, and not all the jokes land, most don't.  There's a couple big laughs but it‚Äôs comedy isn‚Äôt the most memorable part. I must also note that it felt like people were laughing more than me in the theater, so maybe it‚Äôs just me.\n\nIn the end, its very predictable.  You probably have the movie figured out in the first ten minutes, but that doesn‚Äôt stop it from being great.  There‚Äôs genuine emotional moments, and I really found it to be more touching than most of the romantic comedies out there.",

Sometimes they were problematic because of how he needed to secure funding, sometimes they were terrible because the studio had specific requirements, and sometimes they were terrible because Ed Wood, himself had passion but just wasn‚Äôt a good filmmaker.  Through it all, Ed Wood is still lovable, some of his friends and peers see it, others don‚Äôt get it, especially the crossdressing, but he still always had the drive to be a filmmaker.  You gotta admire his ambition if nothing else. \n",

The first ten minutes or so had me thinking this was going to be a plain uninventive movie, but as our protagonist moves from place to place there is more and more intrigue.  Reflecting back on it, the pacing is perfect.  Its best feature is its ability to build excitement and tension from beginning to end.  And the ending is poetic and just feels right. \n\nMy only issue with the movie was some of the acting is just okay.

It's pretty empty and plain on the inside as a movie.  But, good god the VFX are amazing.

      "Review": "Although ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù doesn't come close to breaking free from the horror movie formula, it‚Äôs still a well made film. And even though I probably won‚Äôt end up watching many more films in this series, it does set itself up for a universe well.\n\nThere‚Äôs plenty of jump scares, which always feels like the cheapest and easiest attempt at horror.  Although I was never frightened, this is the kind of stuff that bothers me when it comes to horror movies.  The film is also ‚Äúbased on a true story,‚Äù but saying that feels pretty loose.  Calling this \"based on a true story\" is the most bare minimum version of the truth.  \n\nOnce again, this is still a well made movie, all the actors are all really good.  Even the children are all great in their roles.  If this was made just twenty years ago the piss-poor child acting would have taken me out of the movie. \n\nMaybe my biggest gripe with the film was how It feels like there's a lot of slow moments where nothing ends up happening. Those moments are just there to keep you on your toes, so you think that something will happen eventually.  But instead of building tension it ends up feeling like wasted time.  The writing and the concept itself is the weakest part, it just feels bland and standard.  It‚Äôs still great in terms of direction, James Wan will probably have a solid future with filmmaking like this.",

The first half hour of ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù is used to discuss the character of Jay Gatsby himself, as well as build up his legend and keep you in anticipation.  When we finally meet Gatsby it feels like a big moment.  I mean, there are literally fireworks firing off in the background of a massive party with Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) at the center of it all, smiling and looking back at you with his glass raised high.  \n\nThe movie that follows is wonderful, captivating, dazzling and colorful.  The production design is almost perfect, and one of the strongest elements of this film.  There‚Äôs just a handful of moments throughout the film that feel quite rough around the edges.  It‚Äôs like Baz Luhrmann got this insane budget, but still used the cheapest green screen effects available.  I honestly don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening there, or why‚Ä¶ maybe it was a stylistic choice, which if it is, I still don‚Äôt know why.  \n\nThe story itself is so rich, in addition to the acting and production design, it carries the film.  The legend this film has built for itself, led me to believe it wasn‚Äôt going to be good and it would be chaoticly problematic, but it wasn‚Äôt.

It gives more credence to the films greatness than you may have expected.\n\nI found myself enjoying the performances (acting and music) from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, but I personally didn‚Äôt like their characters.  I would sympathize or empathize with them in moments, it just never got to the point I was rooting for either of them. The actors and their chemistry really make this relationship work, even if the script at times doesn‚Äôt create the same magic.  And although I found their interactions to be compelling from moment to moment, it doesn‚Äôt feel like there was a lot of depth to their romantic relationship\n\nIt‚Äôs not like there are stupid moments in the film, as much as some things just didn‚Äôt add up looking back on it.  More memorably, there are a few very powerful moments in the film, at least two where I got chills just because of how well they worked.  One was seeing Ally (Lady Gaga) perform on the big stage for the first time, and one was near the end of the film.  \n\nThe music is quite good for the most part.  Lady Gaga has an incredible voice, and to nobody‚Äôs surprise, vastly outshines Bradley Cooper in that respect. There‚Äôs a few great songs here and enough solid tracks to round out the soundtrack.\n\nIt‚Äôs a story about one star on the rise, and another one who is not necessarily falling off, but it seems that his best days are behind him.  It leaves you with a lot to reflect on and in the end it hits hard.\n",

These musical numbers are timeless and showcase what peak entertainment was at the time.  It's really amazing, especially for an era where musicals were culturally relevant, this still stands out as a nearly perfect musical.\n\nThe opening scene with the title is quite jarring and didn‚Äôt feel inviting.  I almost turned off the movie when I saw them smiling, singing and dancing towards me, it was borderline satanic.  Some of the story didn‚Äôt hold my attention, and I got bored, though that didn‚Äôt last long because another musical number was always around the corner.\n\nOtherwise, it's just a fun time and an easy watch.

      "Review": "This film exceeded my expectations, and I feel like I‚Äôm higher on it than most people, but I truly think it‚Äôs a great film. It hooks you in from the first scene and quickly showcases its style. The movie has this sense of allure that you want out of a mystery.  Maybe people won‚Äôt feel me on this, but it brings me back to the thrillers from the 40s and 50s, where the story itself might be the strongest element.  All the characters have well defined intriguing personalities and the filmmakers were smart enough to reveal details about them at a steady pace. \n\nThe story will keep you guessing.  It‚Äôs sorta like ‚ÄúThe Hateful Eight‚Äù (2015) but maybe not as good, and it's also the much better version of ‚ÄúHotel Artemis‚Äù (2018).  I really don‚Äôt want to say anything about the specifics of the story because you‚Äôll want to go into this movie knowing as little as possible.  Just know that it mainly takes place in 1970 at a hotel called the ‚ÄúEl Royale‚Äù which is located on the border of California and Nevada.  There are a few people staying there, and there is much to be discovered. \n\nI loved the general style of this film, and it‚Äôs heavy use of music which features a lot of songs from the 60s.  The story is just so compelling, even if there are a few overly slow moments sprinkled in the film.  I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a strong deeper message to be found here, but this movie is great at holding your attention from moment to moment.",

If there was more focus on the concert itself this could've been one of the all time great concert films.  Once again, the performance itself is amazing, and led me to easily watch this in one sitting.\n\nI actually ended up watching some highlights (aka half the movie) the next day as well.

Rosario Dawson is fine addition to the cast and is probably the best actor in the film.  Her performance brought this film up  a half star. \n\nThe scene where characters debate whether the 'Lord of the Rings trilogy' or the original 'Star War trilogy' is better exemplifies why I enjoy these movies.  The characters feel like real people you could know, with all the flaws that make us human.   It still has a few cliches that hold the film  back from being great, but a fun crass watch nonetheless.",

      "Review": "Here‚Äôs a film that takes us back to a time where there was no ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù there were just lunatics and people feared them.  But this is a very well made film.  It feels dated in a lot of ways, that is expected for a movie from the time, but I had hopes this would be more transcendent.  It‚Äôs weird, cause it‚Äôs predictable, but that‚Äôs also due to this films influence.  You can see how filmmakers have been learning from this movie for many years.  It‚Äôs a straight up slasher film, which wasn‚Äôt the most established genre at the time, so I can see how people jumped to see this.  I haven‚Äôt seen many slasher films, or horror films for that matter, but this seems like it might have been the first great/perfectly executed slasher film.  Please tell me if that is not the case.\n\nOnce again, I really do like this movie and it‚Äôs very polished.  As a horror movie it holds up perfectly. That being said, omg child acting was not good in the 70s, and not good in this film either.  Maybe people just didn‚Äôt think kids could act, so they just got whoever, I DON‚ÄôT KNOW.  There‚Äôs definitely some good acting, but no all-time great performances.\n\nAs I said, it does feel dated mostly because the story itself isn‚Äôt that compelling for today's standards at least.  In so, it‚Äôs mostly predictable, but that‚Äôs likely cause it was so innovative at it‚Äôs time and still is influential to this day.  Nevertheless, John Carpenter perfectly executed what he set out to make.  A movie that is tight in its production while scaring and creeping out everyone.\n",

It goes down smooth and feels vaguely inspirational in moments.  It's kinda about that underlying feeling that we're not doing enough with our lives and we're kinda just chugging along moment to moment. \n\nI will say the moment I saw the wallet, I immediately thought the missing negative was in there, then when he threw it away I was 100% sure it was in there.  So that 'surprise/twist' was lost on me and killed the suspense.  And I'm not one to pick up on these things usually.  \n\nWalter Mitty has a likability and relatability to him that really helped the movie work as a whole.  Once again, it's an easy watch and it remained compelling the whole way through, despite some minor plotholes.  The concept is strong enough for the whole movie to stand on, and with the VFX it stands tall.",

The production design and acting are very good, but once again, my enjoyment wasn't really there except in a few brief moments.  \n\nIt's as crazy as \"Mandy\" (2018) though it makes more sense.  It's boring but well done in the same way \"Phantom Thread\" (2017) was last year.  It's in the continuing trend of big budget art-house films for better or worse. \n\nI don't have much else to say about this film.  I won't be watching it again, but it was beautiful in ways I wasn't expecting.   It just all felt kind of aimless in the end.  Most of the witchcraft methods and powers didn't seem clearly defined.

I didn‚Äôt come to theater to learn, I came to be entertained, and I was.  The film does a great job of giving the music itself centerstage.  They tell the backstories to how many of Queen‚Äôs songs/albums were written and recreate the performances, often in spectacular fashion.\n\nThe acting was good all around and helped give the film an emotional backbone.  I was particularly impressed by the editing and transitions which were creative and kept me engaged between musical performances.  There‚Äôs one I remember strongly, which was an ‚Äúuncut‚Äù shot showing a transition from their tour bus on the highway to them recording in the studio to a live performance at a concert venue.  It was quite smooth.  \n\nI‚Äôm probably biased because Queen is one of my all time favorite bands, and I knew every song featured in this film.  Clearly I had a lot of fun watching this film, even if it is kind of bland in its essence.  I was worried they would dwell on the AIDS diagnosis too long to pump the film with more emotion, but it was well placed and didn‚Äôt take away from the main point of this film; the music and the bands friendship, which brought them all joy and made millions of us fans.",

You know the story, and even if you don‚Äôt there aren‚Äôt many, if any unexpected moments, but that‚Äôs not the point.  It‚Äôs just a story about the power of Christmas spirit to bring people together and make them happy.  It's kinda like the story of Scrooge.  A guy who hates Christmas most of his life, only to eventually [SPOILER:] get deep into the Christmas spirit. \n\nThe animation is gorgeous and probably the most impressive aspect of this film.  It‚Äôs colorful, vibrant, with a controlled wackiness that Dr. Suess himself would be proud of.  The attention to detail on the hairs of the Whos and the Grinch himself continually had me amazed.  Especially seeing this in 3-D really made it all the more pronounced. \n\nThe people in the theater and the person I was with gave off a wholesome feeling with contagious laughter.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is lucky that he's so good at everything else because his acting is barely keeping him afloat here. Meanwhile, this is Jake Lloyd‚Äôs greatest performance by a large margin.  He fits his role perfectly.  \n\nThere‚Äôs too many great moments to count, they‚Äôre all little things that add up.  Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) putting a karate belt on his head and doing karate moves to relate to his kid is so very charming.  There‚Äôs several memorable lines, like ‚Äúput that cookie down now‚Äù or \"hey maybe your parents should get a divorce\".  All of the Santa‚Äôs running a toy black market is a great touch, as is that same mall Santa insisting on being called Santa.\n\nThis is one of those movies that‚Äôs cheesy and cliche, but it‚Äôs such a wholesome good time, you forgive it.  My favorite of these moments might have been the two kids doing a genuine high-five after seeing the cat in the hat in the parade. Also seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger knock out a reindeer is peak 90s and is the epitome of what makes this movie awesome. \n\nThe film also features many great pre-9/11 moments.  It was a different time.  But Sinbad‚Äôs bomb being real was hilarious.  It‚Äôs pretty predictable, but also non-stop fun.",

      "Review": "What a poetic film.  This is a layered story about jealousy, suspicion, memories, love, hate and destruction.  It‚Äôs filled with metaphors, but not in the annoying way some art-house movies like to do, where they just present something that makes no sense with little context, and let you decide how to interpret it.  ‚ÄúBurning‚Äù has some of that, but it also has a compelling story in the forefront that held my attention the whole way through.  \n\nBeyond the poetry at play in the story, the filmmaking is elite for 2018.  The cinematography impressed me, even within the most mundane scenery.  It‚Äôs just a beautiful film in every sense. It‚Äôs the kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it well after the credits roll.  It‚Äôs begging for a re-watch so you can pick up on all the little bits of symbolism, foreshadowing and all other aspects that make this top-notch storytelling.\n\nAlso a big shoutout to Steven Yeun who gives my favorite performance in this film.  He was also in my favorite movie of the year (so far), ‚ÄúSorry To Bother You‚Äù where he spoke English and incorporated more comedic elements.  So I give him major respect for being in my two favorite films of the year (so far) playing two very different roles, in two completely different languages.  I look forward to seeing what he does next.\n",

There‚Äôs not a whole lot of diversity in the sets and locations we see the characters go.  It almost completely takes place in the VERY small town of Black Rock.  But that‚Äôs totally okay, because this script is just so tight. \n\nIt‚Äôs a pretty short movie, clocking in at just 80 minutes, which helps that much more to keep this film engaging and compelling. I like Spencer Tracy in the lead role, as the unphased John J. McCreedy.  Everyone around him is either hiding something or trying to make him lose his cool (or both).  They mostly fail at making him mad, and he relentlessly pursues the truth this small town is hiding. \n",

It was foreshadowing the idea of a multiverse and how different each dimension might be.  Although it ended up being a really solid film, it felt like the full potential wouldn‚Äôt be realized in the same way I had hoped for early on.  When I think of the multiverse theory, I think of infinite universes, which led me to believe we would be seeing countless characters from different dimensions, but it ends up being a much smaller number of characters than I had hoped for.  Nevertheless, the animation is still spectacular, diverse and the strongest element of this film. \n\nThe story itself is still really well done.  Just enough subverting expectations and emotional moments to keep you on your toes.  I didn‚Äôt like the way everything got resolved at the end, it felt like the lamest and most generic aspect of this film.  Despite not living up to its full potential, it‚Äôs so well made that most of its faults are easy to forgive.",

      "Review": "A tale of humanity is usually a predictable feel good story, but humanity isn‚Äôt always humane.  ‚ÄúRoma‚Äù tells a real story of humanity, revealing how despicable humans can be, but also how decent and comforting we can be as well. It‚Äôs all done in a notably realistic way, there were many times where I expected a movie-like moment to happen, but every time Alfonso Cuar√≥n chose to depict what would likely happen in real life.  This actually makes the film more compelling because all the emotional moments weren‚Äôt watered down by fantastical fiction.  \n\nCleo (Yalitza Aparicio), the protagonist, is immediately likable and admirable, but never godlike.  She‚Äôs just someone who works hard, doesn‚Äôt always have a lot to say, but is incredibly strong-willed despite her unassuming demeanor.  So you feel for her in her highest and lowest moments, you worry for her and want the best for her.  It‚Äôs mostly a reflection of how quickly I got wrapped up in this movie, which is so very far removed from the life I‚Äôm personally living.  \n\nThe film is filled with clever and profound metaphors.  It‚Äôs the kind of film you could break down every scene, look for symbolism and find it.  Beyond that the cinematography is beautiful and showcases a wide variety of landscapes in Mexico.  We see the stark contrast between those living well, and those struggling to get by.  Even though that‚Äôs not the central theme of this movie, it‚Äôs impossible to overlook and will more than likely cross your mind more than once during your viewing.\n\nAlfonso Cuar√≥n is really one of the most under-discussed great directors of the modern day.  He does a great job creating tension in the most extreme situations (‚ÄúGravity‚Äù & ‚ÄúChildren of Men‚Äù) and he showcases his ability to create that same tension in intense, yet more commonplace situations here in \"Roma\".  I barely even touched on the filmmaking itself which is spectacular with many impressive shots.   \n\nWhen it was all over, it didn‚Äôt feel like anything earth-shattering had happened.  Maybe that was the point, even when someone is going through some of the most important events of their life, the rest of the world just keeps on going.  Most people don‚Äôt care about your business, except the people who love you, who will always be there for you when you need them because they know you‚Äôll be there for them.  It‚Äôs fucking beautiful. ",

So, I don‚Äôt know how it took me 12 years to get around to seeing this movie, but I‚Äôm glad I did.\n\nThe acting is even better than I had anticipated with Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson all giving top notch performances.  The film is littered with foreshadowing, that seemed obvious upon reflection.  Nolan is a master storyteller, and showcases it here.  Many scenes take place out of order, as we saw in ‚ÄúMemento,‚Äù but not as gimmicky as it was in that movie. \n\nI can see how people got mad about the way the film ended, where it kind of breaks some rules, but I didn‚Äôt mind that.

Both Hoffman and Phoenix gives career performances.  Their characters are comparable in the sense they both have a lot of rage beneath the surface, but Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman) is able mostly control that rage, and Freddie Quell (Phoenix) is a constant loose cannon. Even when Quell has changed he‚Äôs still the same.

      "Review": "Neil Armstrong was a very stoic, strong, intelligent, quite man who was calm under pressure, or at least that‚Äôs how Damien Chazelle portrays him.  This is Chazelles third major motion picture after the hugely successful, highly acclaimed, music-centric films; ‚ÄúWhiplash‚Äù (2014) and ‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù (2016).  No one would say this isn‚Äôt a great film in terms of its filmmaking, but many people will (and have) questied its storytelling methods.  It‚Äôs a beautiful looking film with notably good music (mainly the score), which is ironic because Chazelle also uses silence often and powerfully.  It‚Äôs been a common part of space movies, at least since that Space Odyssey to emphasize silence in the vastness of outer space.  \n\nRyan Gosling turns in a very strong performance as Neil Armstrong, but Claire Foy delivers (what might be) an even more powerful performance as his wife, Janet¬π.  They give contrasting performances.  Neil rarely shows his emotions, expect in moments of solitude.  But despite how strong Janet is portrayed to be, we do see her snap a few times, always in a justified senario.  It‚Äôs really amazing to think of the stress Janet (and the other astronaut wives) must have had to live through, especially considering she was often left in the dark as Neil was constantly in precarious situations. \n\nThe movie is more about exploring the kind of person Neil Armstrong was rather than what happened in his life.  He was a reluctant hero, but by all accounts from the people that knew him, he was the right man to become the legend of the human race he will forever be.\n\n\n\n\n\n1: Janet was Neil‚Äôs first wife. This movie does not explore the fact Neil and Janet eventually split after 38 years of marriage in 1990.  It only showcases events from the 1960s.",

They‚Äôre all mixed together well as it shifts between stories. \n\nThe first two segments, \"The Missing Ingredient\" and ‚ÄúThe Wrong Man,‚Äù aren‚Äôt all that good, so I won‚Äôt give them too many words here.  But to say the least, Ted finds himself in some strange scenarios.  \n\nThe third segment \"The Misbehavers\" is directed by Robert Rodriguez it features Antonio Banderas and contains some solid 90s comedy.  It‚Äôs all kind of a set up for one joke, which is just barely worth the payoff, but still fun overall.\n\nThe fourth and most worthwhile segment, is directed Quentin Tarantino, entitled \"The Man from Hollywood\" and features Tarantino himself.  It‚Äôs the kind of story that grabs your attention early on, holds on to it, and just keeps squeezing tighter until the last moment.  This might actually be my favorite acting performance from Tarantino, who‚Äôs playing a bit of a parody of himself.  It never reaches the heights of Tarantino's feature length films, but he does what he can with the 20 minutes or so of film he gets.\n\nAnd Lucy is right, I've never seen something quite like Tim Roth in this film.",

The message it but after-school-specialy but it's in good taste and comedy surrounding the movie is still so delightful.  ",

It's quite remarkable.   \n\nThis Samurai Cop is the worst cop of all time, and is also clearly a model with no acting experience.   His co-stars aren't much better, it felt like no one knew exactly what kind of movie they were in.  It might also be the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie.

It's a movie that kind of lives in an art-house world, but never goes too deep down that path to turn me off.   The soundtrack is nice as well, and may go overlooked, but really helped set the mood for me.  Emma Stone gives the films best performance and is still the most dateable women in Hollywood.  The story is super well written, and has one of the year's best script.\n\nIt's what I wanted the Phantom Thread to be, a weird Victorian tale, but this was is far more stratifying.\n\nNote From the Author:  My seat was in the very front row, and it was a terrible view, so maybe I'll revise this one day.",

      "Review": "\"The House That Jack Built\" is more horrific than horror.  Not scary, as much as it is disturbing.  More The Office than Law & Order.  This probably isn‚Äôt the movie you were expecting, it‚Äôs actually pretty unique, it‚Äôs hard to think of any other well known movies like this.  There‚Äôs plenty of great films about serial killers, and this is another, but it‚Äôs not like the rest, it‚Äôs just a strange film to experience.  It ventures between being an art-house film, to an irreverent comedy, to a slasher film.  And therein lies my beef with this movie.  The tones is reaches for frequently clash with one another to create a somewhat unsmooth viewing experience. \n\nIt‚Äôs also a pretty uncomfortable viewing experience in general.  I mean, it is about a serial killer, so it‚Äôs supposed to be that to some degree.  It often felt that the director, Lars von Trier, purposely made it so his audience would be uncomfortable, but it sorta crosses the line from effective to unnecessary.  I really enjoyed the artistic expression within the film, and the script is incredible and often quite poetic. \n\nOverall, it‚Äôs not an easy watch, and I would be very suspicious of anyone who lists this as one of their favorite movies.  But at the same time, it is really well done, especially Matt Dillon in the lead role as Jack.  And once again, the script is fantastic.  I only wish it could have just been more well paced and smoother overall.",

      "Review": "It‚Äôs weird to see a superhero movie that breaks down the superhero formula before superhero movies really took off.  It‚Äôs the kind of movie that you would have thought was made at least ten years later.  The film explores the elements that make someone a superhero; the desire to help and protect, super strength, super sense and generally being unbreakable. \n\n‚ÄúUnbreakable‚Äù always walks the line between believable and supernatural, and the film mostly stays in that grey area.  A great moment of this in the third act is the ‚ÄòSecurity‚Äô rain jacket we see our protagonist, David Dunn, wear.  From one perspective it‚Äôs simply part of the uniform for his job, from another perspective it‚Äôs a superhero costume, which even resembles a cape at moments.   \n\nThe whole film had a mysterious tone.  It asks the same question many of M. Night Shyamalan‚Äôs films ask which is ‚Äúwhat if magic is real?‚Äù  It‚Äôs quite enjoyable overall, I didn‚Äôt really have any problems with the movie.  It‚Äôs actually quite basic when I reflect back on it, but it‚Äôs well executed and well acted so it glides along pretty smoothly. \n",

      "Review": "During his career, M. Night Shyamalan, (it may be an understatment to say) has had his ups and downs.  He made ‚ÄúThe Sixth Sense‚Äù (1999) which blew the mind of nearly everyone who saw it.  People were sure he was going to be next great director.  He made a few movies that were decently well received after this, but he eventually began falling off until he hit rock bottom with ‚ÄúThe Last Airbender‚Äù (2010).  To this day, some say it was literally the worst movie ever made.  All hope of Shyamalan returning to greatness had seemingly been lost.  I‚Äôm happy to report that the Shyamalan drought is officially over.  ‚ÄúSplit‚Äù is an expertly executed psychological thriller that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nKevin (James McAvoy) is afflicted with dissociative identity disorder and has 23 distinct personalities.  One of his personalities kidnaps three teenage girls for unknown reasons.  Meanwhile, another one of his personalities is meeting with his psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley).  The film cuts between these two events with some flashbacks, as we begin to understand exactly what is happening.  I won‚Äôt go into any more detail about the plot, because (as is the case with thrillers) slowly unraveling the mystery is partly what makes it so engaging.  \"Split‚Äù gets close to being too complicated and confusing, but fortunately Shyamalan is restrained and doesn‚Äôt make it more dense than it needs to be.\n\nI need to take a quick moment to touch on the controversy of ‚ÄúSplit.‚Äù  The disorder Kevin has here, is a real disorder which affects a large number of people.   Some said ‚ÄúSplit represents yet another gross parody of [mental illness] based on fear, ignorance and sensationalism, only much worse.‚Äù  Without a doubt, everyone should know that this is a very serious illness for many people out there.  But, at the same time, this is a fictional movie that is barely in the realm of reality.  So, just be aware watching this, it is not a totally accurate depiction of DID, though I was never expecting that from an M. Night Shyamalan movie.\n\nThere are a few great performances in ‚ÄúSplit,‚Äù but no one comes close to James McAvoy.  His performance as Kevin (and all his other personalities) is jaw-droppingly amazing.  He completely deserves a Best Actor nomination.  I haven‚Äôt seen anyone put on a performance like that in 2017.  To be fair, the role itself is set up to be an acting masterclass, but McAvoy really knocks it out the park.  The films success rested heavily on his shoulders and he‚Äôs probably the biggest reason it‚Äôs as great as it is.  Each personality feels distinct, and drastically changes the tone of the scene depending which side of Kevin we‚Äôre seeing.  I completely bought into the character from the first time he appeared on screen.  It‚Äôs just, captivating.  \n\nKeep in mind, I am not a fan of horror movies at all.  Not at all.  But this is just awesome.  Yes, I was getting scared at moments, but the film isn‚Äôt just going for shock value, it‚Äôs much more thoughtful.  Now, it is certainly very, very disturbing at moments and it is by no means ‚Äòfun for the whole family.‚Äô  Surprisingly, there‚Äôs actually not as much violence and blood as you might expect.  The movie is terrifying in different ways, rather than using jump-scares and gore.  You‚Äôll be horrified because of the story itself, not just the imagery on screen.\n\nThere are some disturbing moments but they were all necessary to tell the story.  I wasn‚Äôt able to find a deeper profound meaning behind the movie like we saw with ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù (2017).  Parts of the film can be fairly predictable.  But I didn‚Äôt really consider that much when watching the movie because it was so intense and suspenseful.  I didn‚Äôt want to look away for a second and I was always engrossed, waiting for the next moment.",

I mean, it kinda makes sense by the end, but even then it constantly took me out of the experience seeing these distorted depictions of the legal system, science, medicine and mental health.  Both ‚ÄúUnbreakable‚Äù (2000) and ‚ÄúSplit‚Äù (2016) never really delved into the scientific aspects of their stories, and I thought that was a wise decision and one reason those are both stronger movies. \n\nThat‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt have fun.  There‚Äôs a lot of good stuff in this movie.  I enjoyed the jokes, and it never seemed to clash with the tone of the story itself.  The action scenes are pretty exciting and sometimes unpredictable.  That‚Äôs what Shyamalan does well, as we all know.  Just when you think you know what‚Äôs happening, he gives you the ol Kansas City Shuffle and switches it up on you. \n\nOnce again James McAvoy turns in the best performance, and was probably given the most lines.  His character has 24 different personalities and he showcases his acting skill/range with a wide variety of personalities.  Also, without spoiling anything, I will say I like how it all ended.  The 1st act and 3rd act were strong, but the middle got a but dull.",

Her character is slowly driven to insanity in a way that reminded me a lot of \"Perfect Blue\" (1997), but I found \"Black Swan\" to be an even more refined experience.  The plot  overall might be predictable, but it's completely unpredictable from moment to moment.  It really caught me off guard in more than one moment.  \n\nThe script and story are super profound, giving you a lot to think about during and after the movie.  I loved how its themes are represented visually and within the dialog, like the juxtaposition between dark and light.  We also see themes of status, age and expectation woven into the movie.  Nina (Natalie Portman) faces inter turmoil and physical deterrents, sometimes these two blur together.  The combination of Portman's flawless acting and Darren Aronofsky's masterful direction makes all this work exquisitely.\n\nTchaikovsky's Swan Lake is arranged and used perfectly as the soundtrack and central performance of the film.  This is an amazingly thoughtful, clever, poetic and captivating film with beautiful imagery from beginning to end.  \"Black Swan\" is Aronofsky's Magnum Opus and one of the decades best.",

It‚Äôs awesome every time.  He always grabs some everyday object nearby and (seemingly in the moment) figures out how to use it to defend himself.  My favorite moment of that in this film has to be him fighting off (what must‚Äôve been) a hundred enemies with a bamboo stick.  It‚Äôs the kind of scene the Wackowskis thought they were making in ‚ÄúThe Matrix Reloaded‚Äù (2003) when Neo fought off countless Smiths with a long poll.

      "Review": "\"the only concert by Queen that was ever shot on film\"\n\nOnce in a while someone asks me \"if you could see anyone/band live in concert, who would it be?\"  My #1 answer is always Queen (followed by James Brown).  They were simply the best live band ever.  Seeing them in real 1080p is bordering on a religious experience.  The performance is hypnotic.  Freddie Mercury is one of the greatest singers in any genre, any time (from what recorded sound we have available).  I must've thought to myself 'goddamn this guy sings perfectly' fifty times during the film.  This is also much better than that movie that just won Best Picture at the Golden Globes. ",

      "Review": "Everyone has their little quirks.  It‚Äôs usually not something you notice unless you know the person really well or you‚Äôre the narrator of this story.   Peoples likes, dislikes and tendencies are part of what makes each person different.  During ‚ÄúLe Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulain‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúAm√©lie‚Äù we get to examine a diverse cast of characters and see all the traits that make them unique.  \n\nOur protagonist Am√©lie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is the perfect person to follow in this story, as she loves studying human behavior and occasionally intervening.  She has many quirky traits like everyone else, but most interestingly she loves to make other people happy, but in secret.   We learn more about Am√©lie through a series of thoughtful and well written scenes between her and her neighbor, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin).  He is a painter and also known as ‚ÄòThe Glass Man‚Äô because of his frail bones.  They discuss her life indirectly by discussing Dutfayels painting and the people within that painting.  These are the only moments Am√©lie opens up about her own life and herself.  She has a tremendous ability and passion for helping others, but her ability to fix her own life is often the most difficult (many of us can relate).  Their conversations feature some of the most profound and poetic dialog in this film. \n\nIt‚Äôs a movie that just does so many things right.  The cinematography is one of the decades best, it‚Äôs beautiful to look at, and creates a memorable tone that is unique to this film.   The casting and performances are pretty much the best you could expect.  As mentioned before, the writing is top notch from a poetic perspective, and it's just very compelling.  Am√©lie is a character that you quickly root for, and can maybe relate to.  It all just works so well. \n\n‚ÄúLe Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulain‚Äù has a whimsical nature and fills your heart with love in a way very few movies have been able to replicate.  It‚Äôs one of the most delightful films I‚Äôve ever seen, and it makes me want to go out and live a better life.",

      "Review": "Today was finally the day I sat down to watch this epic.  The original cut in the US was 139 minutes, the intended release which came out in Europe was 229 minutes, and the Director's Cut which I saw was 250 minutes.  Usually when discussing the length of a film, the complaint is the movie was too long, and pacing suffers because of it.  It‚Äôs rare that you need a movie to be longer, but this is the case here.  In an attempt to make the movie more marketable the studio slashed the length of the film to be more reasonably sized but the story made less sense the smaller it got.  Point being, it probably makes the most sense to watch this epic four hour and ten minute directors cut version. \n\nThe film features its protagonist Noodles (Robert De Niro) and his counterparts at three different point in their lives.  Seeing the gang as kids takes up about the length of a full movie, and I enjoyed it all.  Children are often not the strongest actors, but these kids give good enough performances that it held my attention, and made for a solid (albeit not great) movie within this movie.\n\nIn terms of its presentation, ‚ÄúOnce Upon a Time in America‚Äù is immensely beautiful.  The cinematography looks marvelous even in the films dullest moments.  When this is paired with the masterful compositions of Ennio Morricone, in what may be his finest work, the results keep the movie interesting even if nothing is happening.   Some of the most beautiful scenes didn‚Äôt even contain dialog, like when a young Noodles (Scott Tiler) first catches a glimpse of a young Deborah (Jennifer Connelly) practicing her dance.  This moment lingers for a while and you can‚Äôt help but feel nostalgia being created in that moment, which is a major theme in this film.\n\nYou would think a film of this length would at some point be incoherent or step over its own logic, but remarkably it does not. The film tells a story over the course of nearly 50 years.  It succeeds in creating nostalgia and a (mostly) authentic period piece about kids growing up in crime.  Somewhat surprisingly, it doesn‚Äôt make many of its characters likeable, but maybe it was done to keep things even that much more true to form.  I mean, Noodles (Robert De Niro) rapes two people in this movie which made it nearly impossible to care about the well being of his character after that.  Nevertheless Sergio Leone showcases elite filmmaking here, further cementing him as one of the all time greats.",

      "Review": "Movie MVP: Chris Tucker \n\nChris Tucker's performance as the protagonist, Franklin Maurice Hatchett, is by far the best aspect of this movie.  Everything else just reeks of being an average 90‚Äôs movie.  Which is not to say I didn‚Äôt have fun, this was a greatly enjoyable viewing experience.  But that‚Äôs mostly because I personally love this kind of silly comedy/action movie that you don‚Äôt need to think about too deeply.  The plot is somewhat predictable, but it‚Äôs not the kind of thing you‚Äôre trying to predict either.  It‚Äôs enjoyable because Chris Tucker is oozing charisma and is endlessly hilarious even in the most mundane situations.  \n\nI kinda lost interest a bit by the third act and anything not involving Chris Tucker is just super bland.  His body language is masterful like Jim Carrey or Jerry Lewis.  I also greatly enjoyed all his interactions with Tony Cipriani (Paul Sorvino) who believes Franklin (Chris Tucker) is the son of Vic Damone for the majority of the movie.  It also made me sad that we didn‚Äôt get more movies with Chris Tucker.  It‚Äôs always amazing to see someone who really called it quits while they were on top.",

      "Review": "Like any biopic some stuff might be made up for plot convenience and they gloss over a lot events because a lifetime is longer than a movie.  Despite that, at the heart of ‚ÄúFighting With My Family‚Äù is a surprisingly emotional tale about hard work, tough breaks, family and dream chasing.  This film seemed on track to be a forgetably average biopic about Saraya-Jade ‚ÄúPaige‚Äù Bevis, but it‚Äôs elevated by a strong cast showcasing great performances all around.  Lena Headey, Nick Frost, Jack Lowden and Vince Vaughn are all great in their respective roles.\n\nThe script is pretty thoughtful and contains a plethora of quick-witted insults worthy of the pro wrestling work this film explores.  I was surprised to find myself being moved by the story more than a few times.  The film does a great job of making you understand the physical and emotional challenges Paige (Florence Pugh) went through when she moved from England to the US at young age to pursue her dream.  You forget how hard it is as a young adult to move away from your family after living with them your whole life.  It turns out that might‚Äôve been the bigger challenge than the actual wrestling. \n\nIf you know Paige‚Äôs story, the film (pretty much) loses all it‚Äôs suspense.  I suspect people unfamiliar with this story will find it even more captivating. It‚Äôs a fun story and had me laughing more than a few times.  The weakest element of this film is it‚Äôs visual presentation which is inescapably bland.  Fortunately, the story, script and cast are strong enough to make up for all this films shortcomings.  It‚Äôs not profoundly great, but it‚Äôs still quite good and may exceed expectations. \n",

      "Review": "Who doesn‚Äôt love it when a kids movie has a subtle reference for adults?  Or a mature joke hidden in plain sight written in language kids can‚Äôt fully comprehend?  To me, that‚Äôs one sign of a good kids movie; kids enjoy everything on the surface, and adults get something extra looking a little deeper.  Most kids movies are limited to only a few moments of this, but in ‚ÄúRango‚Äù we get a whole movie of it.  ‚ÄúRango‚Äù is filled with jokes that will go over kids‚Äô heads, and many references to classic (much more mature) films like ‚ÄúChinatown‚Äù (1974), ‚ÄúThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly‚Äù (1966), and ‚ÄúFear and Loathing in Las Vegas‚Äù (1998).  Its story and themes are mostly borrowed from these films and even if it does make things a bit predictable, that‚Äôs not a problem because the movie has a lot to offer beyond suspense.  It‚Äôs animation is beautiful and unlike anything Disney or Pixar would have conceived of.  By the end of it all, ‚ÄúRango‚Äù proved to be one of the best modern westerns I‚Äôve seen.\n\nRango himself is a complex character, he‚Äôs a good mix of delusional, loveable, misguided and good-hearted.  In one sense he is representative of the archetypal wild west hero.  On the other hand he is just a normal nobody with heroic dreams and learned most of what he knows from watching TV.  He never got to put his ambitions into practice until he falls out of a truck at the beginning of his journey in this film.  We‚Äôve all had fantasies of ourselves as a hero of a story, but rarely are we actually put in that situation.  Rango lives his fantasy, then lives reality and comes back stronger than ever.  And like Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone‚Äôs ‚ÄúDollars Trilogy‚Äù (1964-1966) we never learn the true name of our hero, he is everyone and nobody, we just know he was at least once known as ‚ÄúRango.‚Äù\n",

I really enjoyed their depiction of the dark web, pop-ups online and the group of Disney princesses could easily be it's own spin-off.  Seeing the Disney princesses give advice and support to Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) was my favorite segment in the movie, and showcases the diversity and unique personalities within the princesses. \n\nShould they make a third?

      "Review": "I can‚Äôt help but feel a bit disappointed here with the twenty-first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).  It‚Äôs not that ‚ÄúCaptain Marvel‚Äù did anything absurdly wrong, as much as it didn‚Äôt feel wholly fresh.  Maybe it‚Äôs just superhero exhaustion (a moment I thought would never come), but probably not because I‚Äôm totally going to see ‚ÄúShazam‚Äù in a few weeks.  I think it‚Äôs just after this many years of Superhero films, the bar has been raised pretty high.  Overall, I found this film to be quite predictable and lacking fully original concepts.\n\nThat‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt enjoy myself, this formula still works and they didn‚Äôt really make any mistakes along the way.  When the movie tries to be cool it can be pretty badass.  There‚Äôs two moments I‚Äôm thinking of when we see Captain Marvel fully realize her powers and those moments are awesome.  The freshest aspect of this film is finally seeing a female-led Marvel (Comics) film which we somehow haven‚Äôt seen since the travesty that was ‚ÄúElektra‚Äù (2005).  \n\nOur protagonist has amnesia most of the film, and discovering her past is the central plot here.  Amnesia plots are generally cliche, but it‚Äôs serviceable here and hasn‚Äôt been in the MCU if I recall correctly.  Also the filmmakers will keep reminding you that this film takes place in the 1990‚Äôs with references that are thrown in your face rather than being a subtle wink. \n\nBrie Larson is a great actor and a smart pick to play Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel.  The character of Captain Marvel is portrayed well by Larson, but this depiction of Danvers is a bit too flawless.  She doesn‚Äôt really make any mistakes and doesn‚Äôt have (m)any shortcomings that aren‚Äôt circumstantial and comes off as a bit of a Mary Sue.  Samuel L. Jackson continues to be one of the great actors alive, and delivers my favorite performance of this movie as Nick Fury, who is a central character this time around.  We get to see him begin the formation of The Avengers and as always, flex his charisma along the way.\n\nMost of the jokes fell flat with me, and for reference my theater was chuckling a bit more than me, but not much.  My favorite moments in Captain Marvel were the actions scenes, and the moments when it seemed like it was going to be a Brie Larson & Sam Jackson buddy movie.  The chemistry between Larson and Jackson was so good I really wish they embraced it more and relied less on the rest of the cast who mostly seemed disposable.  Far from bad, just disappointingly average.",

      "Review": "In his second feature film, Jordan Peele gives us a story that is immediately compelling and easily outshines any film from 2019 so far (that I‚Äôve seen).  Peele‚Äôs first film ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù (2017) may be superior, but it doesn‚Äôt stop ‚ÄúUs‚Äù from being one of the best films I‚Äôve seen in months.  ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù delivered more laughs than ‚ÄúUs‚Äù, though humor is still noticeably present and mostly on point.  I loved how ‚ÄúUs‚Äù was able to somewhat keep the same tone as ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù while still being distinct.  Both films share some of the same themes, but mostly tell their own tale.  Race was a major theme in ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù but (what may come as a surprise to some) isn‚Äôt really touched upon here.  ‚ÄúUs‚Äù is more ambiguous with its message and requires you to consider the symbolism of everything, but self-reflection is one big theme.\n\n‚ÄúUs‚Äù also showcases the fact Lupita Nyong‚Äôo is one of the best actors working today.  She frequently had me in awe and deeply captivated as she delivered a wide range of emotions within her performance.  It‚Äôs easily the best performance I‚Äôve seen so far this year, and I hope she gets a nomination at the Oscars, but knowing the Academy it‚Äôs less than likely. \n\nThis is a horror film according to Jordan Peele himself, but I drew more parallels to the thrillers in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock or an old Twilight Zone episode.  There aren‚Äôt any big cheap jump scares, rather the suspense and storytelling keep you on the edge of your seat.  There were people in my theaters jumping and gasping, though that wasn‚Äôt everyone in the audience. \n\nThe story is unique and frequently clever. The filmmaking is noticeably crisp and polished.  I found myself admiring the cinematography at play in several shots throughout the movie. More than anything ‚ÄòUs‚Äô is suspenseful and thoughtful.

I don't think anyone at this concert totally knew what was going on other than Jim Morrison and maybe the rest of the band.  The skill and charisma of the rest of the band is unremarkable.  It's mostly cool to see them perform in HD when they were all still young.  \n\nMy friend pointed out to me, it's funny that Elvis was also pretty popular around this time (68 Comeback Special).  You could imagine if you were into Elvis and your little brother was listening to The Doors, you'd be like \"what the fuck is this shit?!'  \n\nI love a lot of their songs.

I personally found it to be much funnier than expected, which may just be because I was in a good mood and saw it with friends, but it gave me too many laughs to count.  \n\nI loved the cast in this movie.  I couldn‚Äôt always tell if it was due to the great actors and or the casting itself (probably both), either way it felt like a strong cast for a movie like this.  It‚Äôs also very comic booky, for better or worse.  For better in the sense it‚Äôs a wacky fun time.  For worse in the sense it‚Äôs often cliche and predictable.  In fact, other than one scene, nothing in this film surprised me plot-wise.  But more than anything this movie is a lot of fun and worth seeing with friends in theaters.  It reminds me of ‚ÄúThor: Ragnarok‚Äù (2017) as one of my favorite 3.5/5 movies I‚Äôve seen in recent years.  Also, along with ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù (2017) it‚Äôs the best post-Nolan DC movie.\n",

Only in the opening scene for a brief moment does it seem like it's going to showcase the admiration and satisfaction that goes along with being a musician.   Rather, the Coen Brothers explore some of the true struggles artists experience.  Some of these struggles are circumstantial, some are part of the trade, and others are brought on by the artists themselves.  \n\nThe story isn't always air tight, and the art direction isn't as brilliant as they think it is.  But I still found it compelling the whole way through.  The Coen Brothers are two of the great directors in the modern day. The film gives you a lot to reflect on.  I wondered if Llewyn Davis‚Äô frustrations and dickish behavior were the reasons for his situation, or a reflection of his situation, maybe both.",

My first question was; does this qualify as a movie?  It‚Äôs not even a full hour, but it presents itself like a movie in the story.  It‚Äôs production values are quite high and thought out, like a movie.  It‚Äôs somewhere between TV movie and mega music video, but it‚Äôs here on Letterboxd so I‚Äôm reviewing it.  \n\nThe film is colorful, vibrant and represents how alive and free music can make us feel.  Or how oppressed we can feel without it.  There are a few songs are woven in (not always subtly) and they're mostly good songs.  It‚Äôs maybe 30-40% music and the rest is storytelling, making this resemble a musical.  Some of the acting (outside Glover himself) is less than stellar and the film is often rough around the edges.  But being as short as it is, it doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome and its production design is so memorable it‚Äôs easy to forgive the flaws.",

I had a few real laughs, and then it's over before you know it.\n\nThe fourth wall breaking is maybe the most memorable bit in this film.  After the husband of a woman he's with shows up, Groucho says \"I'm the plumber. I'm just hanging around in case something goes wrong with her pipes.\"  He then says to the audience he hasn't done that joke in twenty years.  That moment felt very ahead of its time.  What doesn't feel ahead of its time is the general poor representation of women and minorities that seems inescapable in movies from this era.  Still, it's always interesting to see Pre-Code Hollywood.  This isn't perfect, but an easy watch.",

      "Review": "So here we are, eleven years after it all began.  The hype surrounding this movie was enormous and has been building since the first MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movie; ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù (2008).  It seems unrealistic for any film to live up to the hype built by 21 movies.  It‚Äôs a huge task to balance all these characters with intertwined plots, especially considering how dedicated the fans of these films are, and where their expectations are at.  Somehow, some way, the Russo Brothers delivered and made a movie as epic as we hoped for.  As my viewing experience at the theater began to come to an end, I felt this moment turning into a strong memory I‚Äôll look back at for years to come.  The energy and the passion from the audience emanated into the theater for the full three hours of this film.\n \nEven days after seeing it, I‚Äôm still in awe of how so many story arcs came to a close and how none of it felt rushed.  It is a three-hour movie, but I never felt the length, in fact, I was ready for it to be longer.  Despite the enormous amount of characters, everyone gets their spot.  Obviously some people get more screen time than others, but still everyone you‚Äôve loved in the MCU gets at least one moment to shine.  I‚Äôm not going to spoil anything, but when you see it, you‚Äôll see; everyone got a shoutout.\n \nWe all kind of knew this, but it‚Äôs further proven here; the MCU delivers unmatched long term cinematic storytelling.  Others have tried to copy this formula and they will continue to try for years to come, especially considering the massive amount of money the MCU has and is generating‚Ä¶ not to mention Endgame shattering all these box office records itself.  But even as imitators try, no one has done it nearly as well as Marvel.\n \nDuring my viewing, I was also reminded once again of the level of quality of the actors in these movies.  There‚Äôs just so many great actors, and A-List actors at that.  It‚Äôs one of the under-discussed reasons for the success of the MCU.  Superhero movies in the past hadn‚Äôt always spent the money to get top quality actors, but it makes a big difference.  Those serious emotional scenes carry the weight their supposed to because of the skill of the actors. Without the strength of the cast I don‚Äôt think these movies could stand as tall as they do.\n \nLike many films before it, Endgame will be divisive. On one hand, if you‚Äôre a fan of these movies, it hits you with every emotion successfully.  I‚Äôm amazed at the range of feelings Endgame brought me through.  There many small jokes, and many big belly laughs where I missed the next line of dialog because I was still laughing at the last joke. There are sad moments that will continuously beat you down with sadness until your eyes are no longer dry.  There‚Äôs more than a few chill inducing moments that, once again, had me in awe of the power of this film.  In addition to those thoughtful and emotional moments, it obviously features epic clashes between many of your favorite Marvel characters, all of which were awesome.\n \nOn the other hand. if you‚Äôre not a fan of superhero movie and/or the MCU, I don‚Äôt know if this will be the movie to change your mind.  You probably won't love it and may think of it as a lot of fan service and unnecessary action.  But I see it as everything paying off.  If you spent years watching all these movies many times, you will be rewarded here.  If you saw a handful of them and don't remember them much, there will be moments in this movie that go over your head.  Also keep in mind this is very much Infinity War 2, despite not being named that.  So if you didn‚Äôt see Infinity War this won‚Äôt make any sense and you‚Äôre jumping into the middle of the story.  But for those of us following the story up to this point, It‚Äôs an immensely satisfying conclusion to the saga.  Though it should be noted that ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Far From Home‚Äù (2019) comes out in a few months and is supposed to be the true ending to this phase of the MCU.\n \nThis is a movie filled with surprises that will hit you hard, and there are also many predictable moments, but the predictability didn‚Äôt hold down the impact of those scenes.  And yeah, the movie isn‚Äôt perfect, there are a few moments here and there that don‚Äôt totally add up.  But that isn‚Äôt detrimental, and there‚Äôs people flying around and shooting lasers, so I never dive super deep into the logic in films such as these anyway.  I‚Äôve loved the MCU for these last eleven years and was so happy to be in that theater with all those other fans who share this passion.  It feels like there are 14,000,605 memorable moments from this series.  It‚Äôs so satisfying to see all these little moments in previous films coming full circle.  Many of which seemed meaningless at the time, but looking back you see the thoughtful storytelling at play.  I applaud Kevin Feige, The Russo Brothers and everyone that brought these films to life.  And poetically, this time, there is no post-credit scene.",

She has wonderous highs and crashing low, brief moments of questioning, coming back to reality, being bossy, being innocent and everything in between.  With the combination of her performance and strength of the script, it makes for a compelling story.  It‚Äôs about a suburban war happening in one household with one couple, and how they drag another couple into their madness.  Most of the time, their relationship seems very destructive and unhealthy for both of them, but then there are brief moments where you think; maybe they are right for each other.  They verbally battle with each other, with mixed results.  It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre trying to top each others embarrassing secrets of each other.\n\nAt the tale end of the black-and-white era of film, we see thoughtful and well-structured cinematography.

Like all movies based on historical events this is pretty predictable, since we know what‚Äôs going to happen, and it's often bland.  There‚Äôs a few moments with interesting shots and cinematography, but for the most part it's all about the events that led to this major breaking news story.\n\nRobert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are both good in their respective roles as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.  Their acting is pretty good, especially for the time and totally serviceable for these characters.  Sometimes it felt like there were too many people getting discussed and I lost the point of certain scenes. All I knew in those moments is they were trying to confirm specific names.  Maybe if I saw this film in the 1970s the names would have meant more to me, but other than Nixon, Ford and Kissinger I didn‚Äôt know any of people being discussed.  My favorite moments were the ways Woodward and Bernstein got the people they were interviewing to confirm certain information without actually doing so; ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have a problem if you printed a story like that‚Äù.\n\nIt was kind of boring, but there aren't any true problems with the filmmaking and the subject matter is fascinating.

I thought this was supposed to be one of the greatest comedies of it's time, like \"Airplane\" (1980), \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975) or \"Life of Brian\" (1979).  But rather, it delivers dated humor and many premises with punchlines that you can see coming miles away.   Although I did laugh more times than I can remember, what I was more impressed by was how the different elements in the story tied together.  Even though I found it to be completely predictable, its not very long and is generally enjoyable.   I was never totally sure if this was racist or not, but it felt like it walked that line the whole movie.  \n\nYou can see how other comedians and comedies in the years to come would be influenced by this.

      "Review": "There‚Äôs a coming-of-age movie every generation, well really every year, actually there‚Äôs multiple every year.  Point being, most coming of age movies represent their time and we can look back at them as a timestamp of that era.  ‚ÄúBooksmart‚Äù falls in line with that, it is a movie that perfectly captures 2019 and the values of our time, at least for kids growing up in Los Angeles. \n\nI really do love movies like this.  It follows two girls on their last day of high school, that night and graduation the next day.   The story takes them between many locations, unexpected adventures and a wide variety of characters.  I love these kind of movies, because they never really get boring.  Things are moving, changing and developing at a pace that effortlessly held my attention the whole time.  \n\nIt‚Äôs a good looking movie with thoughtful cinematography, and a fun soundtrack that makes it breeze along all that much more.  It‚Äôs incredibly charming and pulled me in early on after seeing the two main characters dance with each other before they drive to school.  Although I wasn‚Äôt laughing all the way through and the ending was a tad bit predictable, it‚Äôs still quite enjoyable.  You‚Äôve seen this kind of movie before, but Olivia Wilde and co really nailed it this time around. ",

      "Review": "What this film does best (other than the performance itself) is giving the context as to why this was as extraordinary as it was when it happened.  They explain the legend and mystery surrounding Jimi Hendrix as he rose to fame in England.  The film stresses the fact all the best guitarist of the time were obsessed with Jimi, and maybe threatened by his skill.  You see why The Jimi Hendrix Experience playing Monterey in 1967 was a huge deal when it happened and how it blew the minds of everyone watching that day.\n\nThe performance itself is as breathtaking as you might expect.  Jimi is looking gloriously flamboyant and shreds in ways I can't comprehend, even more than 50 years later.  We don't see him play too many songs, and the camera work isn't stellar.  But when he is playing, it's up there with the best live performances I've ever seen.  Jimi Hendrix is probably the greatest guitarist to ever live.  It's amazing to see him perform in his prime in high definition, especially considering how historic this moment has become.",

A woman who runs a ramen shop is down on her luck and the quality of her ramen is mediocre.  Until a mysterious stranger, reminiscent of an old school western hero shows up and ends up coaching her to make better ramen.  With the help of a few others, they might just turn this shop around!\n\nThe greatness that is ‚ÄúTampopo‚Äù goes beyond its story.  It‚Äôs a movie that goes above and beyond the whole way through.  With masterfully mundane cinematography, interweaving plots, clever editing and camera work this movie is just so well made.  It‚Äôs a feel good movie and it‚Äôs pretty predictable within its main plotline, albeit still very satisfying.  It‚Äôs a love letter to food and all the things that surround it, whether it be funny, tragic or heartwarming.  It all goes down so smooth, I look forward to my next watch.",

He adds adult-wit to a family-friendly movie, and it would've lost it's edge without him.\n\nThe VFX were outstanding and continually impressed me.

Dylan speaks with so much wit and insight, his 2019 interviews were by far the best interviews in the film.  For the most part other interviewees just seem to try and take credit for Dylan‚Äôs success and things he did, it may be true in some of those scenarios but even still it came off arrogant and ugly.  But to reiterate, all the interviews with Dylan himself were gold.  \n\nThe songs from the concerts were amazing to see in such good quality.

Really a list of issues that filmmakers today often try to step around.  But looking past this, it‚Äôs a well made and clever movie.  The script is witty and provided many laughs even in the darkest moments.  The movie kept evolving, and at least on a first viewing, I was never sure what type of movie this was until the final act.  It‚Äôs color scheme appears quite deliberate and made the emotions of each scene all the more pronounced.    I also really appreciated the fashion and costumes here, it was very of it‚Äôs time, but nevertheless, it‚Äôs just a nice looking movie.  In addition to the pacing being on point, this is one of those gems from the eighties that is just a rare breed.\n\nMy favorite quotes:\n\"I love my dead, gay son\"\n\"Well fuck me gently with a chainsaw\"",

Her character is a bit over-the-top villainous, but she is over-the-top hilarious. \n\nMy biggest problem with this movie is the logic.  The mechanisms that led to The Beatles (and many other things) being deleted from the world are never explained or even alluded to.  It also felt like this movie didn‚Äôt have a point to it.  There were moments where it felt like they were getting to a message; something about the joy of music, love and hollowness that can come with fame.

It‚Äôs a pretty incredible movie, it might not hook you in from the very beginning, but sooner or later you‚Äôll be glued to the screen.  Super compelling and well-paced, the dialog is thoughtful and the story is intriguing.  I had also feared it would be too much of a ‚Äúwhat do you think it's about?‚Äù kind of movie.  But it ended up feeling much more grounded, then, say, ‚ÄúMulholland Drive‚Äù (2001), which is also great btw.  2001 was a big year for film.  In that year Jake Gyllenhaal was also in ‚ÄúDonnie Darko‚Äù and on the other end of the spectrum he was in ‚ÄúBubble Boy‚Äù (2001), obviously the former is a much more impressive performance.  Jake Gyllenhaal definitely has the best performance in this movie, you can see him shaping into one of the greatest actors of the modern day.  He plays a troubled young man, and really shows the (sometimes subtle) uneasiness that comes along with mental illness.  With his acting, he‚Äôs rarely overtly crazed, rather it always seems to be bubbling below the surface, except when he‚Äôs being hypnotized by his therapist.  His acting really elevates the movie.\n\nIt‚Äôs also a decently funny movie at moments, mostly because you‚Äôre not expecting it, but it helps to break up the intensity brought on by the apocalyptic themes; ‚ÄúSometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.‚Äù  When it‚Äôs not being funny, it‚Äôs touching on profound concepts, whether it be time travel, linguistics, life & death, free will & fate; it‚Äôs all tied together in a clever way.  It also seems like the kind of thing that will reward repeat viewings, so I do see myself going back to rewatch this one day.",

      "Review": "Does this movie really need to be three hours long? It kinda does.  There‚Äôs three very distinct acts in ‚ÄúThe Deer Hunter.‚Äù  The first act is slow and just shows how normal life is for this group of friends; they go to work, get drinks, have laughs, spend time with the women they love and occasionally go deer hunting.  If the first act seems slow, it‚Äôs because regular life isn‚Äôt always the most exciting, it‚Äôs often mundane.  The second act begins abruptly and brings us into the horrors and intensity that is war, it‚Äôs the Vietnam War in this case but there aren‚Äôt any political statements about that war specifically here.  The themes more so touch on the destructive nature of war itself, on and off the battlefield.  The third act brings us back to the US where not much has changed with their friends back home, but the same can not be said about the soldiers.  When they come back from combat, they are not the same, and you can see how they affect the people around them (for better or worse) with their new perspective.  \n\nThe russian roulette scenes are obviously very gripping, and have been criticized as a false depectiction of the vietnamesse people.  In my mind those russian roulette scenes serve more as a motif rather than a statement about the vietnamesse people.  Going to war is gambling with your life, and there is often no rhyme or reason to who dies and who survives.  Even after the fighting is over, there may still be a war within the mind of the soldier.  \n\nOverall I found this film to be incredibly well made, beautifully shot and very moving in moments.  Despite starting slow, it became more compelling as it went on.  It also features some of the best actors to ever live, namely; Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep, who all deliver strong performances.  It left me with a lot to think about, which is always a sign of a great movie.",

Also it takes place in Boston so I'm giving it a bit of a boost because of that. \n\nI really loved \"stick your finger in the loop of my tag\".",

      "Review": "Well rounded, colorful, fun at times, dark and depressing at other times.  ‚ÄúBoogie Nights‚Äù film really hits a lot of notes in terms of emotion (and in terms of music, with a funky soundtrack).  It has a lot of intertwining stories that all play off each other and contrast one another.  The transition from the 1970s into the 1980s serves as a noticeable shift in storylines and characters that works quite well.  Mark Wahlberg is great in the lead role, playing a good kid that isn‚Äôt the smartest and is ripe to be exploited, for better or worse.  But really the whole cast is so stacked and many of them turn in great performances. Julianne Moore gives my favorite performance as the matriarchal head of the house, showing that though she is very troubled herself, she still manages to be caring to all the people around her.  It does a lot of things right, it‚Äôs not perfect but there‚Äôs always so many exciting things happening on screen that holding my attention was never a struggle.",

      "Review": "Quentin Tarantino does it again.  With my expectation sky high, this film still delivered.  Tarantino creates a film that is compelling while still being somewhat aimless.  It's a film about the characters, their interactions, their revelations, their journeys, their symbolism and their differences.  When we left the theater, my friends and I were discussing the film for hours, and in the days that followed.  We all had so much fun analyzing the film, and discussing its themes.  And it‚Äôs not one of those ‚Äúeveryone interprets it differently‚Äù kind of films, which I usually don't like, this has direction and purpose.  Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCapripo deliver strong performances and were the joint MVPs of the movie.  The contrast between their characters is just so thoughtful and interesting.  Rich Dalton (DiCapripo) plays a cowboy, tough guy and gets a lot of glory/praise, but struggles with the simpler things in life.  Cliff Booth (Pitt) is the stuntman for Dalton, he doesn‚Äôt get much praise, but he is living the life of a modern day cowboy and is a true tough guy.  He doesn‚Äôt get the accolades, but he is cool and seemingly satisfied with the simple things in life. \n\nIt‚Äôs super funny too.  I lost track of all the laughs I had, but they were continuous.  It‚Äôs almost a pure comedy with some dramatic elements.  Kind of reminds me of ‚ÄúThe Big Lebowski‚Äù in that sense.  If this is Tarantino‚Äôs last film, he ended on a high note, but if it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôll be in the theater for the  tenth. \n",

      "Review": "I hadn‚Äôt expected this film to be as cartoonish and ridiculous as it is.  Early on it felt like an old-world remake of ‚ÄúThe Warriors‚Äù (1979).  It just gets so crazy in the way the gangs are presented and how their fights play out (also maybe this is all accurate and I'm just unaware, but idk).  That‚Äôs not to say it isn‚Äôt enjoyable, I just expected a more grounded exploration of old New York.  To be fair, they set the tone early on that the film will be as I described.  That aspect of the film prevents me from rating it too high, but it‚Äôs still compelling most of the time.  \n\nI found the Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) storyline less interesting, mostly because it felt shoehorned in.  It‚Äôs like they were almost done with the movie and then thought ‚Äòwait, this is too masculine, and we have no female characters, let‚Äôs get Cameron Diaz and give her something to do.‚Äô  It wasn‚Äôt her performance that bothered me as much as it was the lack of fluidity with her integration in the plot.  There are many great performances in ‚ÄúGangs of New York,‚Äù but, good god, Daniel Day-Lewis is fucking amazing.  It was actually one of the best performances I‚Äôve ever seen in a movie, I was glued to the screen whenever Bill 'The Butcher' (Day-Lewis) appeared.  I can‚Äôt give this film anything less than four stars, simply due to his performance.  Overall, this is filled with some huge peaks and plenty of valleys.  But mostly Daniel Day-Lewis is so so so so so good in this, like goddamn, wow.",

      "Review": "Honestly even during the opening credits I felt \"Parasite\" was going to be a brilliant film.  Just from the sleekness in it‚Äôs design and camera work in those opening shots, it seemed likely this would be a great film.  Over the next 132 minutes I was not disappointed.  It‚Äôs a film that‚Äôs quickly engaging and doesn‚Äôt take long to become thrilling.  \n\nThe acting is top notch from everyone (actually everyone) which compliments a very thoughtful and layered script.  It‚Äôs a profound film that touches on a lot of relevant themes of today; mainly social status, wealth inequality, family, and still there is more to the film.  The film gives depth to the experiences of economic inequality on both sides, making it a very relevant film for the modern day.  They leave it ambiguous enough where it‚Äôs just not telling you what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong, though it may appear that way on first glance.  It‚Äôs a film that requires you to pay attention to the small subtle symbolic moments to fully appreciate it.  Still, if you just watch the film at face value, it‚Äôs still gripping.  There‚Äôs so much depth to the storytelling, it never lost my attention for a moment.  There‚Äôs always something to examine, and even if there wasn't, it's just a good looking movie.  The cinematography and editing are amazing, just a thing of beauty.  And it‚Äôs hard to imagine how the music could be better.  Still, from all this, the pacing remains strong the whole way through.  \n\n‚ÄúParasite‚Äù is unpredictable, but never makes crazy jumps in logic just to be unpredictable.  Despite how crazy it gets, it‚Äôs still reasonably grounded in reality.  Somehow through all of this, it still remains fresh and original.  It was really a breathtaking film, made up of all the elements that make a great movie great.  Masterful filmmaking from Bong Joon-ho.",

On top of the touching story and brilliant acting from Shimura, the film is shot very well.  The cinematography is some of the best I can remember seeing from this era.  With shots that look aesthetically pleasing and help tell the story in the framing of those shots.  \n\nIt's just really touching and inspiring in a timeless way.

The script features lots of witty dialog, usually Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) trying to extract information from people while keeping his own agenda and clues closely guarded.  It weaves a complex story with many characters with various motivations.  Every person is a different piece to the mystery which slowly unfolds through the 114 minute runtime.  I loved the clever and often sarcastic comments from Marlowe anytime someone presses him for information, it got me to chuckle a few times.  The camerawork is noticeably thoughtful, and the cinematography isn‚Äôt bad either.  My biggest issue with the film is the fact that I was often bored during my viewing.  It feels like there were so many steps to get to the final result that it just lost my interest at moments... maybe this would be different on a second watch. \n\nAlso all these white people look the same and I couldn‚Äôt always tell them apart.  They also refer to them by their first and last names at different points, so I have to keep track of all these white people and their full names‚Ä¶ not easy.

      "Review": "Another one that alluded me for too long. Very much up my alley and it delivered. Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is an aspiring comedian with pretty much no experience. He appears to be composed and ambitious at first, but as time goes on and we look closer he is completely insane. He is a stalker/fan/admirer of Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) who is a veteran of the entertainment industry, and maybe a bit jaded by it. Pupkin doesn't take no for an answer and walks the line between being driven and overbearing. I loved the performance from Jerry Lewis, who doesn't always say much but his facial expressions and body language speak volumes to his annoyance and impatience. The pacing is great and builds to a perfect climax.\n\nAs a comedian in NYC myself, I was interested to see Rupert Pupkins tight five. It seemed like they might never show it, and just imply it instead. But I was pleased to see it near the end of the film, and especially for the 1980s it was very solid. If this really was someone's first set ever, I would think they had a lot of potential.",

      "Review": "A very delightful experience that was even more endearing than I had anticipated.  Didn't think I would be able to identify with the protagonist, or care about her well-being, but I quickly got wrapped up in the story.  It's just such a pleasant movie, in terms of plot and in terms of presentation.  I loved how colorful and scenic the whole thing was.  Every frame feels well crafted and even if it was on mute I would be admiring the beautiful animation.  The story isn't super complex, but I still found it compelling despite how tired I was watching this late at night.  I also loved how many female characters there were, even without putting too much focus on womanhood.   I feel like you could have switched the sex of most of the characters and it still would've worked.  Kinda woke for the 1980s.  ",

      "Review": "What a grand adventure!  Once again I am drawn into another world Hayao Miyazaki created.  This time we get what would be an exploration of the ocean, but 'in the sky' as the title suggest.  This tale is filled with pirates, hidden treasure, epic battles and chases, and so much more.  I love how the scenery constantly changed and the world Miyazaki created is just so imaginative.   The film ages quite well, with beautiful animation and (once again) strong female characters.   And more so than most of the Miyazaki films I've seen thus far, \"Castle in the Sky\" delivers a genuine sense of excitement.  We see the characters in risky situations and it maintains a feeling of high stakes throughout.  The best moments of this film are comparably thrilling to my favorite non-animated action movies. \n\nThough it's not the most unpredictable, it plays out smoothly and doesn't feel like it wastes time.  I also love how long it takes to get to the titular castle, it really made that reveal feel like a big moment.  Again, better than I expected, and I look forward to finishing Miyazakis filmography.",

      "Review": "Probably the most delightful and wholesome Miyazaki film I've come across thus far.  There were multiple moments during my viewing where I laughed, not always because it was funny, but it was just so overwhelmingly cute.  It is a true G-Rated movie, and never approaches anything dark but this doesn't hold it back at all.  The animation is dazzling, as I've come to expect from Miyazaki.  The colors are bright and reek of positivity, much like \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" (1989), it makes it hard not to smile during the majority of the film.  The English voice acting cast is surprisingly stacked with Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Liam Neeson, and Betty White all playing parts.  I wasn't crazy about some of the character designs, but it's a very easy thing to overlook and it's a personal preference after all.  It's not the most profound of his films, but what stuck out to me most was the intensely wholesome nature of the film, I just felt good about life when this was all over.",

Once again Miyazaki showcases his seemingly endlessly brilliant imagination.   The world in \"Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle\" is unlike any of his other movies, but with themes we have seen before.  It's darker than some of his other films, and definitely not wholesome in the same way in the way \"Ponyo\" was.   \n\nAfter the beginning, the movie never really lost my attention.  Though the end result might be predictable, it doesn't stop the story and animation from being compelling.  The story might have the same old 'beauty is on the inside' message we've seen in many films, but \"Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle\" has more uniqueness to it that you'll have to experience for yourselves.

This was satisfying nostalgia watch for me, as I remember watching this movie many times as a kid.  It never really goes above and beyond, but I love these kind of fun '90s action movies.  It's also longer than you might expect, but that boosts up the movie a bit tbh.

      "Review": "Better than ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù (2018), probably because it doesn‚Äôt try to stay grounded in reality.  It‚Äôs also the better version of \"Across the Universe\" (2007).  \n\n‚ÄúRocketman‚Äù embraces the fantastical nature of Elton John‚Äôs life and the film itself.  It regularly ventures into fantasy sequences that serve as musical numbers or some makeshift music video.  These are often visually spectacular and showcase the impressive vocals of its lead, Taron Egerton.  Like ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù the editing and production design are quite impressive.  There‚Äôs a huge catalog of mega hits to choose from and I loved hearing them, as I was already of fan of the music Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote.  \n\nThe film also opened by eyes to how close Elton and Bernie were as friends.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like this film is perfectly accurate with its facts, but Bernie Taupin comes off looking like one of the few decent people in Eltons life, and apparently his best friend.  It‚Äôs a pretty sad movie, I didn‚Äôt realize the amount of shit Elton John has to deal with in his life.  It doesn‚Äôt feature any of his 28 sober years, but somehow I imagine that movie wouldn‚Äôt be as interesting.  It definitely has more than a few moments of being clich√©, but as a fantasy/musical that‚Äôs pretty forgivable. \n\nOverall, maybe the best aspect of the movie is how it does things only a movie can.  It‚Äôs that medium specificity that makes it all worthwhile.  It gave you what an Elton John concert couldn‚Äôt, not that one is better than the other, but I was just hooked in the movie.",

      "Review": "There are some people that life just shits on and doesn‚Äôt stop shitting on.  It gets to the point where it‚Äôs hard to keep a smile on.  Arthur Fleck (aka Joker) is one of these people.  He struggles to find happiness and doesn‚Äôt get many wins in life. It gets to the point you can understand it breaking a man.  Clearly, that can be taken to a problematic extreme.\n\nAs many people have pointed out ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù has influences from Martin Scorsese‚Äôs ‚ÄúTaxi Driver‚Äù (1976) and ‚ÄúThe King of Comedy‚Äù (1982) but sometimes it felt like they border on being a remake rather than a subtle nod.  This film borrows so much from those two that it took away from the originality of ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù itself.  Fortunately, this film has a lot going for it beyond that.  Joaquin Phoenix once again proves himself to be one of the very best actors working today.  He keeps the character of Arthur Fleck sympathetic, yet despicable and confusing throughout the movie.\n\nIt‚Äôs a well shot movie too, but some of that was lost on me because the projectionist at my theater didn‚Äôt center the image properly and the bottom of the picture was off screen a bit.  Overall, this movie is really dark, and will not brighten your spirits.  But there‚Äôs a lot to the storytelling which touches on mental illness, inceldom and class disparity.  It‚Äôs definitely a movie that leaves you wanting to discuss and analyze it.  And again, Joaquin Phoenix is so good at acting.",

It‚Äôs no secret that Hitchcock was ahead of his time and a master of filmmaking, and here is yet another example.  Even in his earliest color films, Hitchcock uses color in clever and thoughtful ways; usually to emphasize a theme or emotion.  It‚Äôs a beautiful movie (beyond Grace Kelly and Brigitte Auber‚Äôs looks).  The colors really pop with luscious and gorgeous scenery.  I loved those aerial shots of the French Riviera, it‚Äôs beaches and the car chases on the road.  \n\nIt‚Äôs not totally this movies fault; but I do get sick of these massive age gaps in relationships in movies from this era.  I mean, Cary Grant is literally 25 years older than Grace Kelly, and that is barely addressed at any point.  Brigitte Auber is one year younger than Grace Kelly, and was supposed to be a teenager, and I just never bought it.  That much took me out of the movie more than once.  I know it was a common thing in movies from that time, but it was distracting on a personal level.  \n\nThe plot was pretty predictable, but that‚Äôs partially due to the age of the film.  The storytelling along the way was compelling enough that it didn‚Äôt take away from the film too much.  Grace Kelly‚Äôs performance was my favorite, as she plays coy, clever, stoic and passionate very well.  It would have been nice to see her in more movies over the years, but it‚Äôs understandable why she retired.  I didn‚Äôt have too many complaints about the movie.  Hitchcock knew what he was doing.",

The film is often unsettling, but that's largely in part to Dennis Hopper's portrayal of the films villain 'Frank Booth' who is completely insane and psychotic.\n\nI cannot deny how compelling the film is.  The symbolism and thematic storytelling is usually what is discussed here, and it is well done.  But I was more surprised at just how glued to the screen I was.  The whole sequence of Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) breaking into Dorothy Vallens' (Isabella Rossellini) apartment had me on the edge of my seat.  \n\nI'm sure there's more subtleties to the movie that I missed on first viewing.

      "Review": "This is a film that made me very uncomfortable, but in a good way, in the way the filmmakers intended.  At this point in my life, movies don‚Äôt really scare me, but when done right they can still give a thrill.  More than anything, ‚ÄúRosemary‚Äôs Baby‚Äù is thrilling.  I went in knowing almost nothing about the film‚Äôs plot (other than Rosemary would have a baby), which led to a very satisfying unraveling of this mystery.  It‚Äôs pacing is pretty close to perfect.  I suspected I knew where this movie was going, but it‚Äôs left ambiguous enough that I was never quite sure.  Mia Farrow is great as the protagonist, her slow descent into madness is subtle and moves at a believable rate.  It‚Äôs well shot too, I loved the color pallets and different outfits everyone had, which also serve as a nice way to visualize the passing of time.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm amazed how cheap apartments in Manhattan were 50 years ago.  Either that, or Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) is apparently making 30 times as much money as me, because my room is the size of their closet.",

Despite focusing very much on the artistic nature of the film, and symbolism of the story itself, it‚Äôs still a very compelling experience.  Though, more than anything I was impressed with the craftsmanship of everyone involved in the making of this film; the cinematography (gorgeous), the acting (top tier), the soundtrack (perfectly compliments everything on screen), and the editing (godly).\n\nIt‚Äôs subtle storytelling is quite admirable, but the fact this film isn‚Äôt going to be digestible for everyone is a reflection of what prevents it from being really great.  But it‚Äôs also not one of those films that so ambiguous there‚Äôs no direction.  It feels purposeful and yet still vague enough to remain poetic.  It has a lot to do with power, madness vs reality, truth and more I certainly missed.  Probably something to do with Prometheus, but in America, as others have pointed out.\n\nAlso, it was subtle, but I was very impressed by the use of small everyday sounds getting incorporated into the rhythms of the soundtrack.  Like seeing a bird tapping its beak on the glass, and it being in time with the beat of the soundtrack.  Those little things add up, making this look like a very polished film.",

Just sit there, and observe other people in their natural state, see their interactions, imagining their whole lives.  It's a good time.  That's one thing \"Grass\" showcases really well.  \n\nIt's a very mundane movie.  Nothing out of the ordinary really happens.  Some characters are experiencing powerful moments within their lives, but since those aren't the central characters, it just feels like a momentary observation.   It's like when I walk by a couple screaming at each other on the sidewalk, and I just kinda raise my eyebrows and think \"they're having a fucked up day,\" then I move on with my life.  \n\nWe see our protagonist, Areum (Kim Min-hee), mostly able to remain objective and uninvolved with the lives of the others she sees.   That is until her brother is introduced and we see she has similar insecurities and issues as all the people she's been observing.  Maybe it's just that it feels better to observe and remain distant, rather than get yourself involved and be hurt.  But then, that can leave us emotionally cold.  It leaves you with a lot to think about.  The mundane nature of the film kept it from being completely compelling, but I still found it quite interesting.",

Her performance goes beyond what an average actor would do and really brought that much more life to the film.  The rest of the characters are well casted for sure, but Florence Pugh's performance just vastly overshadows everyone, I look forward to seeing her more in the future. \n\nIt's a film that leaves you with a lot to think about and analyze, which I appreciated.  To me, it's a film about isolation, finding acceptance and moving on from the negative in your life.  Those who were seeing a story with a more literal meaning will likely come away confused or disappointed.  It doesn't fully satisfy like a conventional story, but it's certainly thoughtful and engaging.  ",

Whether those days be in a physical home or an emotional home that's no longer accessible, people will go to great lengths to preserve that memory.   \"The Last Black Man in San Francisco\" tells this story while showcasing the juxtaposition between life in the city of San Francisco and life on the outskirts of the city, where the socioeconomic situation is much more dire. \n\nThis is quite an impressive debut feature for director, Joe Talbot, and lead actor Jimmie Fails who plays Jimmie Fails.  It almost reminds me of \"The Jackie Robinson Story\" (1950), with the protagonist playing himself and telling his own story.  The film has many thoughtful shots and a profound script.  It stands out too, and feels pretty unique in 2019 where rehashing stories and making sequels is the norm.  It's not flawless, it's just the slightest bit rough around the edges with the pacing and some of the acting.

You often get that from Pixar films or Studio Ghibli, but it's often not that well done with network TV.

The first half of the concert they do a lot of songs from 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason' and 'The Division Bell' which were made after Roger Waters left the band.  Those songs are noticeably weaker.  \n\nObviously a band is going to do their new stuff and their old stuff in a concert, but their old stuff, in this case, is vastly superior.    We do get to see 'Dark Side of the Moon' played in it's entirety which is just incredible.  It breaks away a little bit from the studio recordings of these songs, so it stays interesting.

It seems like there‚Äôs countless murder mystery novels, but there just haven‚Äôt been too many movies in the genre recently.  Clearly, Rian Johnson is a fan of them as well, and here, he delivers a slick, clever, well-written good ol‚Äô murder mystery.  With a fleshed out cast of great actors, this is the kind of movie I love. \n\nThis movie does a lot of things right; the soundtrack is marvelous, the casting is perfect, the writing is witty, and it‚Äôs just a good looking movie. But the parts that felt off are hard to explain without spoiling.  Basically certain pieces of information are revealed more quickly than I had expected.  It confused me, but ultimately, as time went on I optimistically saw it as breaking the mold and subverting expectations. \n\nThe strongest elements of this movie are the script, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas, who both deliver (very different) memorable performances. The script does a great job of pivoting between being poetic and being silly, often making fun of this genre itself.  Although it wasn‚Äôt totally unpredictable, and it didn‚Äôt keep me guessing until the very end, the world of ‚ÄúKnives Out‚Äù and the ride it took me on was quite enjoyable.\n",

It‚Äôs pretty much just as good as the first, maybe a little bit better, just because a lot of set up work was done in the first film.  The action is better, more characters, and we see a bit of a team up between the mutants which is cool, but I had my doubts about how long that would last.  Beyond being a superhero movie, it‚Äôs just an exciting action film that had me quite captivated.  I really liked all the interweaving storylines, it kept things interesting the whole way through, even if it‚Äôs slightly predictable.  I‚Äôll definitely be watching the rest of these and re-watching 1 & 2 one day. \n\nAlso the name X2 is so 2003.",

      "Review": "Just when you thought the world had enough gangster movies, Martin Scorsese and pals, somehow, deliver a fresh perspective on the genre.  Movies like this often glamorize the gangster lifestyle, but they don‚Äôt usually showcase the real life these people live beyond their exploits.  All these gangsters are people too, some with families and they certainly have the same fragile bodies all of us have.  The film begs the question, even if you don‚Äôt die in prison or get killed by a rival gang, did you win?  In the case of the films protagonist, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) it certainly seems he went on living with a few regrets.  \n\nI didn‚Äôt expect the film to be so heartbreaking in moments.  The compromises some of these characters have to make are just so sorrowful sometimes.  It‚Äôs mostly a reflection that this film is truly great, and I was invested in these characters and their relationships.  \n\nThe de-aging CGI is noticeable at first, but I mostly forgot about it as the movie went on, and it‚Äôs not so problematic that it takes away from the film itself.  My only minor complaint about the movie, is sometimes the actors still show their age in their movements even though their appearance looks as if they‚Äôre 30 years younger.  They do a pretty good job compensating for this, for the most part, but there are a few moments I could see through that. \n\nThe performances from the three leads; De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are masterful.  Even if this film wasn‚Äôt as good as it is, it‚Äôs still a delight to see these three legendary actors share the screen.  They also have a great script to work with, with subtle threats and gangster speak.  The movie has so many powerful lines that can cut deep with only a few words.  I was glued to the screen the whole time, and never checked the time or my phone once.  Three and a half hours is a long time to remain compelling, but evidently, these masters of filmmaking have pulled it off.\n\nAlso, I kinda wish this was called \"I Heard You Paint Houses\", that would've been a better title.",

It's not only about the obvious problems created by murders, but how it can spill over and affect the whole community.  The fact they don't catch the murderer leads to more problems and violence just caused by the craze of this all; and it's a reflection of the incompetence of the police themselves.  Their unprofessionalism is almost comical in moments... especially all those dropkicks.\n\nAs I've come to expect from Bong Joon-ho, it's a really well shot movie.  All the scenes are thoughtfully framed and just aesthetically pleasing.\n\nWikipedia taught me that this murderer was eventually caught, more than a decade later.  But the message of the movie still stands; sometimes a murderer doesn't look crazy, sinister or evil, they just appear to be a plain and ordinary person, like anyone else.",

Sylvester Stallone deserves a lot of credit for playing him, obviously, but the character himself is a brilliant creation, and a timeless cinema hero.\n\nApollo Creed is a great antagonist, not necessarily a villain, but he just contrasts Rocky well as a more traditional champion.\n\nThe story itself is pretty simple, but there's so much charm to these characters it just works and goes down smooth.

Throughout the movie, even with each problem solved, more and more problems arise.  \"Uncut Gems\" starts moving pretty quickly, and doesn‚Äôt really give you a chance to breathe until it‚Äôs all over.  It‚Äôs really the essence of a great thriller.  I was glued to the screen.  Some may view it as a claustrophobic film, but I mostly found it exciting.\n\nBeyond the thrills, there are many funny moments that I laughed at, though it's not really a comedy.  It‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt need to remain fully serious the whole way through. I also found it cool how there was some integration with real events, even though I remember the outcome of the basketball games showcased in the film.\n\nAdam Sandler is perfectly cast as a veteran New York jeweler who‚Äôs deeply entrenched in the life of NYC‚Äôs Diamond District.  Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is quite a tragic character.  The film is largely a character study of Howard himself.  He‚Äôs trapped in his own disease, which is an addiction to winning, whatever that may pertain to.  It could be winning a bet, making a sale, or a victory in his personal life.  He‚Äôs so addicted to winning, we even see him confusing the high of winning with love.  Ultimately it seems he is sad behind the front he puts on, even if winning brings him a brief orgasmic joy.  It‚Äôs also about knowing people on different levels.  Howard has associates from jeweling and associates from being Jewish.  When those worlds clash, the ethics can become ambiguous.  \n\nThis is a thriller that goes beyond just being thrilling, with above average artistic direction and themes of greed, addiction and wealth, it makes New York City a perfect location for it all to take place.\n\nAlso the soundtrack is super A24y",

      "Review": "Despite me giving positive reviews to all the movies in this new trilogy of Star Wars, this is the worst trilogy overall (of the episodic Star Wars canon).  Say what you will about the prequels, but at least reflecting back on it, there are complete thoughtful story arcs.  And obviously the original trilogy is the strongest in almost every way.  Although ‚ÄúRise of Skywalker‚Äù is a fine movie on its own, it seems so odd within the larger context of the series.  It‚Äôs also very clear there was little to no plan discussed between Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams, as this trilogy is incredibly incohesive. \n\nCasting is one thing they really got right here.  This trilogy features the best acting of the whole series.  Even if the other films had good performances, there was always someone dragging it down with sub-par acting.  Also C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) gets some well-deserved shine in this film, delivering some of the movies funnier lines. Chemistry between the leads is entertaining to see.  It makes me wonder why it took til the third movie to get Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) all going on an adventure together.\n\nThe action and set pieces satisfy.  The locations of some of these fights are truly epic.  The lightsaber battles do not disappoint, with some of the best duels of this trilogy.  As you might expect they play on nostalgia more than once.  As a long-time Star Wars fan, those moments of nostalgia usually worked on me.  Personally, just seeing and hearing the lightsabers usually gets me perked up.\n\nMuch like ‚ÄúThe Force Awakens‚Äù JJ Abrams deliverers another very safe movie.  There aren‚Äôt many crazy unpredictable twists there just for the sake of subverting expectations.  In fact (besides one big reveal) I found most of this film quite predictable. As I have mentioned in some of my other reviews of this series; at the end of the day, it‚Äôs still Star Wars, so they kind of already got me.  Despite the noticeable flaws, it‚Äôs not going to stop me from watching these movies till the end of time.",

Clearly a lasting story with themes of; growing up, family, societal expectations and love.  The story is great at providing timeless, powerful messages.  \n\nIt's pacing is oddly fast.  You would almost think this was an action movie, with how fast it moves between events.  I imagine there a a 3-4 hour cut of this somewhere that is an even better move.  I mean, the book is like 800 pages, and this movie is barely over 2 hours, which kinda speaks for itself.  Nevertheless, a nice note to end the year on.",

      "Review": "It's nice when a documentary decides to focus on a specific moment or event in life, rather than try to explain someones whole life in 90 minutes.  \n\n\"When We Were Kings\" is solely focused on 'The Rumble in the Jungle,' a legendary boxing event that took place in Zaire in 1974.  Though we learn a lot about all the people involved in this event, it's largely a showcase of the charisma, wit and skill of Muhammad Ali, and what he meant symbolically to the people in Zaire (and around the world).  This fight was a huge deal for a number of reasons, and the documentary really shows you the magnitude of this moment in time.  Muhammad Ali was an extraordinary athlete and deeply noble person.  He comes off as a true hero, and almost a god in this film, and I don't think that's overstating things.  \n\nMy favorite interviews were those with Norman Mailer, whose passion and articulate thoughts tell the story almost as well as the historic footage of the event itself.  The footage of the fight and moments leading to it are in great quality.  At its climax, this film gave me chills.  It's quite a powerful movie. ",

The runtime doesn‚Äôt fly by, it‚Äôs a patient movie that takes it‚Äôs time to tell the story at a comfortable pace. It moves along at a realistic rate; many plotlines are present at once, and they weave in and out believably.  It never felt like it was trying to force any plot in, it all just felt so natural, everything that happens. \n\nThere‚Äôs so many characters, they mostly have traits that make them unique, and they all seem so fleshed out.  Despite this, I personally lost track of many of the characters and who was who; maybe because I‚Äôm racist, maybe because there‚Äôs too many of them, or maybe because my brain is too weak.  \n\nIt‚Äôs just such an impressively crafted film; Edward Yang delivers an incredibly thoughtful script.  It touches on a variety of personal and political topics; growing up, influence, love and hate.   It all unravels at such a steady pace, that make the impactful moments stand out that much more and makes them feel earned.  Beyond the poetic script, it‚Äôs an astonishingly well shot movie, one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen.  The framing of each shot usually has something to say, and if it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs just aesthetically pleasing. \n\nAnd I can‚Äôt stop listening to the soundtrack, it really complements the film well.

But it gives you as much info as it needs to, and you learn from what you see on screen.  The themes are those you've seen in war movies before; it's about persistence and showcasing how gruesome war can be. \n\nInterestingly, the protagonists don't fire many bullets, it's definitely not a film that glorifies violence, but rather just shows what it is; relentless and horrific.  The production design and editing are breathtaking, and probably the most memorable aspect of the film.  The performances are fantastic and the script is what it needs to be.  It's just really strong filmmaking... it always feels like everything has been done when it comes to war movies, but somehow Sam Mendes delivered a WW1 film that feels fresh. ",

I literally woke up the next day thinking about this documentary, with images of Benny Perkins waxing poetic in my brain.  It centers around a competition to win a truck.  Taking place in a small town in Texas in 1995.  24 contestants put their hands on the truck, last person with their hand on it wins.  It‚Äôs an endurance contest. \n\nThe interviews with the contestants range from insightful to bizarre, to fascinating.  But the interviews with Benny Perkins were my favorite.  He won the competition in 1992, so he knows what it takes to win.  Like everyone in the competition, he seemed to be born and raised in Longview, Texas and never left. You might think he's just an unthoughtful, small town Texan.  But somehow he still came off as a supremely wise man, like he had learned some profound life lessons from this competition.  He had the zen of a monk who meditated in the mountains for a lifetime.  \n\nThe range of people in the competition really adds to the interest of the film.  People have all sorts of strategies; nutrition, exercise, religion, Snickers, cigarettes, and everything in between. It reminded me of a reality show, like ‚ÄòSurvivor‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe Real World,‚Äô except none of the contestants are there for fame or glory, they literally just want this truck.  As they point out in the film, a truck is a deeply meaningful and important thing to have in Texas.\n\nEverything in this film is so genuine, and even if the production budget is next to nothing, it has so much charm and intrigue, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

The plot is borrowed from a few classic tales, which all come together in a nice hodgepodge of themes.  The production design is awesome, and feels kind of ahead of its time, it almost felt like an 80s movie.  The music is mostly good, and I was not surprised to learn it was all written by a prolific and respected songwriter of the time, Paul Williams, who also stars as the titular character.   Some of the songs feel like blatant rip offs of better songs from the time, but other songs are actually quite infectious.\n\nOverall, just a really memorable and enjoyable film.  It's a bit rough around the edges a few times... especially some of the acting.   The more De Palma I watch, the more clear it is why he's one of the greats, and evidently he loves a good conspiracy.

It‚Äôs so much more than that.  It‚Äôs about William Gates and Arthur Agee, their families, their community, and the people who financially have something to gain.  All these people want them to succeed, some of them putting their own sense of self worth in these basketball prodigies.  \n\nIt‚Äôs a showcase of the very real struggles of families in deeply impoverished community which they barely stay afloat in.  Basketball is the only glimmer of hope many times.  It can be a painful film to see in moments, not only because of the adversity and consistent uphill battle they fight, but knowing how long this had been happening to so many people (often black Americans) and is still happening to this day.  It‚Äôs sad to see some places that only have their backs when they're scoring points.  \n\n‚ÄúHoop Dreams‚Äù is a powerful and deeply moving film.

Not many noticeable special effects, the actors are all really in these situations.  The authenticity is noticeable and greatly strengthens the film. \n\nAlso seems like this influenced \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979) just a bit.",

      "Review": "A perfectly crafted film.  With a deeply poetic script and flawless acting from the whole cast, it's easy to see why this is considered one of the great films ever made.  The cinematography is gorgeous, some of the best I can remember seeing from this era.  There's so many immaculate frames in this movie, even the more mundane shots just of someones face look perfect.\n\nEven though this speaks to a lot of specifics elements of Japaneses culture that might've gone over my head, it's still structured in a way you can infer most of this and still get the message.   The story deals with the concept of honor, how we often overlook flaws in a system, and who writes history.  I kept thinking about this movie well after it was over, and just wanted to discuss the concepts this film touches on.  Even if the specifics events in this film are hard to relate to, the concepts and themes are still applicable today.  Masterful filmmaking.  ",

It's a constant battle between morality and profit, and the latter is usually the victor.  Even in the moments someone finds success, it's usually short lived, as if it was a smell... \"I am tasting my favorite new perfume - success!\"\n\nIt's an awesome script filled with clever one liners and old school NYC fast-talking chatter.  Some of the best lines in the script had me in awe, and I was surprised to see many of them being treated as throwaway lines. It's also a well shot movie with a cool vibe.  Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis are perfect in the lead roles, but the rest of the cast isn't necessarily as stellar.  Overall though, it holds up well and is a quick watch.",

Though I assume there‚Äôs something to those moments, and maybe I just have to meditate on them more.  Even though it may appear to be paced slowly, the major moments in the film are so impactful and intense, that you kind of need that time to digest and reflect on it.  \n\n‚ÄúCome and See‚Äù is so well shot, it surprised me to learn the director has done little else of notability.  It felt like nearly every frame had something to say, and/or it elicited strong feelings with its imagery alone.

I had expected this to be more of a straight up comedy, but the film touches on a wider range of emotions than it appears.  It‚Äôs a really polished movie with a beautiful production design beyond what I had imagined.  I was looking at this world they build of Nazi Germany at it‚Äôs height, and most of me is thinking ‚Äòthis is terrible, one of the most shameful moments in human history, just deeply saddening,‚Äô but part of me was thinking ‚Äòwow this is a good looking city, they really had their shit together.‚Äô  \n\nNot every emotional moment hit me super hard, but the story arcs of the characters and the message of the film are beautiful.",

Even though most of the film follows our protagonists adult life, it doesn't lose its sense of childlike wonderment.  Miyazaki shows us you can dream big and make it happen, slowly but surely you're dreams can become your life.  \n\nThere is some heavy subject matter that gives the film more of an emotional weight than I expected.  Nevertheless, the film wholly delivers on what it set out to do.  The animation is so dazzling and the exploration between dreams and visions is quite imaginative.  The filmmaking varies throughout the movie, and at times felt like it was paying tribute to different styles.   One sequence with a hat flying through the wind almost felt like it was a scene from the silent era of film.\n\nSome moments of dragged on and the pacing wasn't always on point for me.  But the film tells a beautiful story with impeccable execution.  Miyazaki is clearly one the greats.  I'm all caught up with his films now, until 2021.",

Some will see this as ambitious, poetic and clever, where others will see it as insanity and nonsense; as for me, I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle.  Although I respect the unconventional storytelling, playing some scenes on shuffle and the general free jazz nature of it all... sometimes it‚Äôs just annoying how incoherent it can be.  It‚Äôs certainly interesting to see the western genre deconstructed with ‚Äúheavy doses of Christian symbolism and Eastern philosophy‚Äù (as Wikipedia puts it).  It‚Äôs so strikingly and undeniably weird in many moments that it had me saying ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù out loud to myself several times.  \n\nThe cinematography is easy to admire, as is the production design as a whole.  That much doesn't get bogged down by the avant-gardeness of it.  The editing often comes off as spastic as does the behavior of the characters.  It‚Äôll also be memorable for being super violent (especially for it‚Äôs time) and a few scenes they probably couldn‚Äôt get away with today. \n\nAll the moments to make a full story are there, but it‚Äôs not always smooth or coherent.  It actually felt like this movie will be better as a memory than a viewing experience. In my mind, I remember all three acts and all the story-arcs, but when I watched I was just confused and uncomfortable.  This is certainly a weird one.\n\nEDIT:  Lowering this to a 3/5 because I was outright not enjoying myself at several moments during the movie. ",

This film shows the sad ending to the communities the native Americans had before Christopher Columbus and his goons destroyed and stole everything from them - to eventually create the United States where all men are created equal lol.  The story is told through the perspective of one of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù white men, who actually had the patience, wherewithal and perspective to take the time to learn about the Sioux.  As opposed to every other white man who barbarically looked at them as animals to be shot on sight.\n\nAnd yeah, it‚Äôs totally a white savior movie, but even through that lens it still makes its point.\n\nThe film features solid acting, beautifully shot scenery, a somewhat predictable plot and more than a few cliche moments.  There‚Äôs also a few moments that made no sense to me at all, like one early on with someone killing themselves.  I assumed some of this would be explained in the (four hour) extended edition, but this movie already doesn‚Äôt fly by at three hours.  Despite being kinda generic, the film still held my attention most of the time.  \n\nEven though the point the movie is making has been made before, it‚Äôs worth repeating because the genocide of native Americans is one of the most tragic pieces of this countries history.  By the end, I found the movie's message to be pretty impactful despite it being unoriginal.  It‚Äôs really sad how more Americans didn‚Äôt realize how the natives were just people living their lives, just like us, perhaps even living a fuller life.",

Other than sharing one character, Jesus Quintana (John Turturro), and just one bowling scene, this film has nothing to do with the film it spun off from.  For appearing to be a somewhat cheap movie, It has a weirdly stacked cast with appearances from Audrey Tautou, Bobby Cannavale, Jon Hamm, Christopher Walken, Susan Sarandon, Pete Davidson and even J.B. Smoove.  The film is somewhat aimless, which isn‚Äôt the issue because ‚ÄúThe Big Lebowski‚Äù is sorta that too.  The issue the film never made me care about any of the characters, they‚Äôre either thinly developed or shitty people I can‚Äôt get behind.  Many of the story arcs and plot points had me either scratching or shaking my head. At some point it started to feel more like an extended episode of ‚Äú2 Stupid Dogs‚Äù (1993-1995) rather than a feature length film.   \n\nI didn‚Äôt hate the movie, it‚Äôs fun in moments, but even at 85 minutes it felt too long.  It made me laugh a few times and do like these kind of aimless adventure movies that keep the scenery and characters changing, but it‚Äôs just not tight as it could be.",

With that in mind, any mildly competent movie might become a kids favorite movie of all time.  But sometimes filmmakers use this as an excuse not to try.  That is somewhat the story of \"Sonic the Hedgehog\".\n\nSonic (Ben Schwartz) and Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) do entertain, but the rest of the film kinda falls flat.  Just super generic and predictable.  Still, it's not terrible, just not good.  It would have been unbearable without the redesign though.\n\nAlso a couple of blatant X-Men rip offs in there. \n",

It‚Äôs a deep cast with big names and major talent, which is entertaining in itself, just being surprised and delighted by the faces on screen.\n\nThe cinematography and production design is pretty much perfect in my eyes. One of my favorites in any movie ever.  The script is witty, humorous and occasionally poetic.  I like seeing the more poetic moments in the script clash with the moments of crassness, the juxtaposition makes for some funny scenes.\n\nIt‚Äôs a commentary on the hospitality industry; sometimes it‚Äôs glorious how great the sophisticated life can be, and sometimes it‚Äôs just silly.  \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" entertains me on so many levels: great actors, a clever script, and an interesting story with a point; sometimes in life, we find ourselves striving to preserve things that are still here, to remind us of something that isn‚Äôt there anymore. \n\n‚ÄúTo be frank, I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it - but, I will say: he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace!‚Äù",

Though it's not something that bothered me much since I was having too much fun watching.  It's also fairly predictable, but it never presents itself as a suspenseful thriller, so I didn't get too hung up on that either.  It's just one of those good time movies that goes down smooth.

Even though his behavior is quite unadmirable, he still drew me in each time he was on screen. \n\nDespite the short runtime, I still felt like this could have been shorter.  It felt like an overlong episode of a TV show in the style of 'The Twilight Zone'.  By the third act is got a bit contrived.  Still a cool movie though.",

Sandra Bullock gives a great performance, which is almost certainly the most memorable aspect of the movie.  She is funny and very like-able.  The movies blandness is that much more obvious when she's off screen.  Michael Caine also has a very endearing performance.  April 25th was a great day to watch this.",

      "Review": "Appropriately, this is a very zenful movie.  Despite several awesome action sequences, the film maintains a peaceful demeanor most of the time.  The pacing is slow, but I never felt like the (three hour) movie was too long.  It lingers in moments that give the film a meditative and dream-like quality to it.  In conjunction with the misty production design and generally beautiful cinematography, the film starts to feel like a spiritual journey. \n\nAs someone who is a big fan of martial arts films, this is clearly a step above the rest.  It‚Äôs a very well crafted film with a thoughtful story and many interesting characters, including a strong female character, in the 70s.  I was happily on board for the entirety of this ride, the film cuts between the action, the story and the zenfulness gracefully.  Its influence is clear to see, especially in something like ‚ÄúCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon‚Äú (2000).  It‚Äôs just a really cool movie that has many of the elements I love to see - amazing action, great visuals and a well paced compelling story.  Despite the long runtime, it‚Äôs a film I‚Äôd gladly rewatch.",

Too many amazing jokes to count, which I probably quoted for the 10 years after this movie came out.  \n\nThe four male leads all deliver amazing serious performances, with their characters having blindly confident ignorance.  Christina Applegate's performance gives great contrast; showcasing how stupid some of the logic was that the world abided by in the 70s.  Her performance is quite funny in itself, but in a more subtle way.  The cast is stacked and I just find the movie relentlessly entertaining.

Lewis plays Stanley (The Bellboy) who basically doesn't speak the whole movie.  It creates many comedic moments and serves as a nice wink to the silent era of film.  More than anything, \"The Bellboy\" is a funny movie, and was funnier than \"Mallrats\" (1995), which I watched the night before, for what that's worth.\n\nJim Carrey probably learned a lot from Jerry Lewis, I can see a lot of the influence in his physical expressive comedy.  There's also a couple cool cameos, and one fake cameo that's still kinda cool.  \n\nOverall a very fun movie, and more high-concept than I was expecting.

      "Review": "A fascinating and captivating look into one of the greatest teams ever assembled in the history of the NBA, and into one of the greatest athletes in the history of Earth.  Michael Jordan is an important figure in history beyond basketball, his influence ripples beyond the world of sports.  He‚Äôs been a very private person since retiring from competition, so it made these new interviews all the more interesting.  ‚ÄúThe Last Dance‚Äù brings us into his psyche, his flaws and gives us some concrete explanations of rumors/stories from over the years.  We see his teammates, coaches and management, and how they all played a part in the Chicago Bulls championships over the years.  The interviews with Bulls head coach (1989-98), Phil Jackson, were some of my favorites.  He is a deeply thoughtful person and his zen like presence on and off the court reeked of wisdom.\n\nThe coolest thing for me was seeing the unreleased HD footage from the 97-98 season, and the new interviews.  That much was going to be great regardless of the direction.  Nevertheless, the documentary manages to be emotionally provoking, insightful and occasionally profound.  MJ and others provide great insight about success, winning, competition, what it takes to get there and the side effects of that lifestyle, for better or worse.\n\nAs a basketball fan, I was going to enjoy this no matter what, but it was even more compelling than I had expected.  I was glued to the screen the whole time.  Even though I knew most of this story going into it, the filmmakers do a great job of putting into perspective how unreal and amazing it was to win all those championships, and what a big fucking deal it was.

      "Review": "This maybe the David Lynch movie I've enjoyed the most so far.  Just the right amount of weirdness.  Wild people going on a journey through a wild place.  Cage is very good in his role, with just the right amount of crazy.  It parallels \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) in ways I couldn't have expected, with increasingly overt references to that film, and I thought it all fit very well.  \n\nMaybe I'm just starting to understand Lynch, but everything felt purposeful even when it was being strange.  Sometimes David Lynch movies feel like they're being weird and random just for the sake of it (though that's probably due to my lack of understanding).  This time the surrealism was really cool and satisfying to see (thinking of the singing).   Still, it's a bit over the top in moments, but I certainly enjoyed myself. ",

      "Review": "Everything this movie puts forth had been true for a long time, even if it's only seeing the light of day for some people in 2020.  With style, thought and humor Spike Lee tells the story of a day that was too damn hot, and brings a neighborhood to its boiling point.  There's always conflict in any neighborhood but sometimes all it takes is a hot day to push people over the line.\n\nSpike Lee creates so many different and memorable characters that you feel like you've known for a long time, despite this movie only being two hours.  It all feels so natural and real.  These little situations and conflicts always speak to so much more than the small moment they exist in.  The film does, pretty much, everything right.  \n\nWhat I love is - in these conflicts, often times, no one is in the wrong.  Sometimes headstrong people who are both justified, refuse to budge and a conflict ensues.  In the movie these conflicts range from minute to life-altering.  But that is life.  All you can try to do is... the right thing.",

The jokes get pretty dark, so it may not be for everyone.   Even though it's predictable, it still has heart and I found it to be moving in a few moments.  The acting is solid and it all seems pretty grounded in reality.

      "Review": "Humanity can be so cruel to those who are different.  We often fear the unknown, or that which is unusual.  That's the story of John Merrick aka The Elephant Man, a real man with sever physical deformities from Victorian era England.  People are often physically or verbally abusive towards him, and even when they're not, they're overly fascinated with him, treating him like a rare artifact.  In either case, it's the kind of treatment that makes John feel less than human.  These moments can be tough to watch, as you can only try to imagine what the real person went through.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the film teaches us how the power of simple kindness goes a long way.  There are more than a few particularly powerful moments in this regard - being offered a cup of tea by a beautiful woman, or just being called a friend - you can see how much that meant to John.\n\nAt first I thought this movie was well made, but telling a generic story.  By the end I found it to be very moving and endearing.  On top of that, David Lynch provides a perfect tone for the story being told.  Other than \"The Straight Story\" (1999) this is, maybe surprisingly, his most normal and grounded film.  David Lynch is really great at making movies.",

Or is he dead already? When did he die?... on (or before) the train, after getting shot, after meeting Nobody, or not til the very end?  The film works on so many levels and it aids the dreamy nature of the whole thing; which is complimented by the meandering, spacey and occasionally heavy guitar of the soundtrack. \n\nBeyond the story telling between the lines, there‚Äôs a compelling story on the surface - a wanted man on the run.  Seeing William Blake (Johnny Depp) going on an adventure, that‚Äôs really more like a spiritual journey, is consistently interesting in itself.  The surrounding characters and people he meets along the way kept the film from getting too dreary at any point.  Jarmusch inserts a lot of extended moments with no dialog for two reasons; 1) allow time for reflection, as an audience member, and as anyone at the end of their life might do, and 2) allow time for the soundtrack to shine, which is masterfully created by Neil Young. \n\nThe tone, ambiance, soundtrack, concept, cast and script all make this movie work so well.

      "Review": "Like many other of David Lynch's films, \"Lost Highway\" is very dreamy throughout.  I was never sure when the dream started, or if it ever did, but I could tell this wasn't all real.\n\nWatching a David Lynch film is kinda like listening to a Bob Dylan song.  Frequently what you're seeing is only a metaphor for another (often more complex) idea.  This symbolic storytelling works so well in his films because he is a great filmmaker to begin with.  The whole thing is very compelling even when I didn't know exactly what was happening.  The action on screen is interesting enough, and when/if interest dwindles we're given something surreal or otherworldly to wake us up.\n\nThe story of \"Lost Highway\" is a representation of a man dealing with who he is, what he's done and what about him compelled him to do so.  Some of this we see literally, but most of it is poetically told with (often violent) symbolism.  \n\nAfter watching every David Lynch movie now, I found this to actually make sense.

Jim Jarmusch gives this movie such a cool tone, and the music compliments this perfectly.  I like how Jarmusch skips over some moments in the story, just cause you can imagine what happened there (and maybe to save money).  This also aids the pacing, which always leaves enough room to breath.  \n\nTom Waits is awesome here, but Roberto Benigni steals the show, in one of his earliest performances.  Benigni is entertaining and endearing as he tries to form bonds with these other two men, and learn he subtleties of the english language.  Just a great vibe to it all.",

      "Review": "One of the great works of art I can remember seeing.  It‚Äôs so very original, creative, clever, poignant, well executed and just a toe tapping fun time.  \n\nThis cast is so strong (it made many of them stars), everyone is great in their role and so many of them pull off all-time great performances.  Nearly all of them can sing their butts off, and the rapping is totally passable (though notably less honed).  Daveed Diggs is the exception to this, as his rapping is steps above the rest, he comes off as a true pro in this regard.  \n\nThe very concept to put together a hip-hop musical about Alexander Hamilton sounded questionable the first time I heard of it.  But after listening to the soundtrack and seeing how perfectly crafted this all was, I was simply in awe.  Every song is packed with references to theater history, hip-hop history and self-referential to earlier themes in the show.  Beyond the references, it's filled with historically accurate information, plenty of humor and obviously moves the story along.  The melodies are intricate, varied and just super enjoyable to listen to.\n\nThe sets and costumes are minimal but super effective.  Everything happening on stage is already so perfect, it doesn‚Äôt need any intricate setpieces to hold your attention.  In addition, the ensemble is used so cleverly, they morph into different people, objects, or something symbolic whenever needed.  I‚Äôm not always paying attention to them, but they‚Äôre always adding to the scene when being utilized, and just working super hard.  \n\nThe history, musicality, innovation, craftsmanship and skill of the creators and performers still has me amazed.  I know this isn‚Äôt a unique opinion or anything.  But Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius.\n",

      "Review": "One of the more daring and hilarious movies I‚Äôve seen in awhile. This is a film that optimizes freedom of filmmaking.  The kind of movie you have no doubt that the director had total creative control.  Tom Green goes full insanity here, in all respects.  The script, sexuality and just the ideas behind this movie are fully insane. Most insane of all is Tom Green‚Äôs performance, which is why this movie works for me - he fully commits every time.  You see him doing something crazy in his actions - jerking off animals, or whatever - and you look in his eyes to see what appears to be genuine madness. The level he takes it to when freaking out astounded me and was what makes it so funny.\n\nI also think this flick makes sense, at least more sense than some people give it credit for. My interpretation was a meta story of Tom Green himself getting the funding to make a movie like this.  It‚Äôs kinda like he's saying to the studio \"Do you have any idea how big of a fool I am? You really want to  give me $14 million to make a feature length film? Well, let's see what I can get away with and if you‚Äôre even watching.\"\n\nYou can see why the critics of the time panned this.  They thought they were getting just another modern comedy.  Instead they get a deeply vile and offensive production with seemingly no point to it.  Now that the film community has had time to let this age and be reflected on, we can see it's really a misunderstood classic.",

That's something that often doesn't translate well for very old films such as this, but here it does, thanks to a strong performance from Toshiro Mifune as the films protagonist - he is cool, calm, calculated and seemingly unbreakable.  His character is definitely the most interesting in the film.  \n\nTo no ones surprise, it's really well directed and and every shot feels very thought out.  As you may know, this is the same story as \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964), because I'd seen that prior I knew many beats of this story ahead of time.  Despite this, the movie remained reasonably compelling.  It has a lot of cool moments and I see why this translated well to the wild west.  I do think the story could've been slimmed down, at times it felt like there were too many moving pieces and made things drag just a bit.

Toshiro Mifune is still the star and is still cool as fuck, maybe even more so this time.  He is easily bored, immensely wise, sometimes lazy and a total badass.\n\nWhat I loved about this especially is how we're dropped right into the story from the jump.  It doesn't take long to get the ball rolling.  Seeing Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) outthink everyone, while being a superior swordsman kept me engaged the entire time.  It doesn't really dip in the middle, like many movies tend to do.   The ending is awesome and satisfying as well.  \n\nAnd obviously super well directed by Akira Kurosawa - the filming is very thoughtful in every moment.  And again, Toshiro Mifune is the man.  ",

On top of that, the sets, locations and general filming is basically perfect, it's a beauty to see.\n\nThis loose adaptation of King Lear is just so well made, and the story is so well told, though it is clearly tragic.  It's poetic in every aspect: cinematography, writing, music and other parts of film I'm forgetting.  It's just so thoughtfully and meticulously made, once again, I am here to bask in the greatness of Akira Kurosawa.",

      "Review": "A nice fun and easy watch.  Obviously the comparisons to \"Groundhog Day\" (1993) are being made by everyone, but I found this different enough that it didn't feel like a retread.   We meet Nyles (Andy Samburg) much farther along in the loop than we met the protagonist of \"Groundhog Day\" and that definitely works in the movie's favor.  Cristin Milioti, as Sarah, gives the best performance of the film.  She shows off a wide range of convincing emotional states, and hopefully it earns her more roles in the future.  \n\n\"Palm Springs\" is very well shot with a secluded tropical style that often showcases a sense of isolation and loneliness.  The color pallet was on point and is visually a very pleasant film for the most part.  It's a cool concept, albeit slightly unoriginal, by the end it kinda felt like an extended episode of the Twilight Zone. \n\nI found the movie to be decently funny, giving me more than a few real laughs.  I also really liked J. K. Simmons as Roy, that character made things a little more interesting.",

      "Review": "A breathtaking, magical, visually and audibly spectacular trip through the dreams of a man - that man being Akira Kurosawa.  Obviously the filmmaking itself is masterful at every turn, it's just so polished in its presentation, it's a beauty to look at.  His previous film, \"Ran\" (1985), had great use of colors, but mostly just emphasized a few primary colors, but here in \"Dreams\" we see Kurosawa use the whole rainbow (as the poster would suggest).\n\nAll eight segments really feel like dreams: there's no beginning or end to each dream, characters are rarely assigned names, events and people are usually symbolic rather than literal, they inspire a state of wonderment and sometimes they just seem crazy.\n\nThe pacing is super slow and patient, maybe to be reflective, which makes sense for Akira Kurosawa, who was 80-years-old at the time of the films release.  That works well considering the profound themes of the film; life, death, love, war, art.  This being my 10th Akira Kurosawa film, I'm truly in awe of his skill and talent for filmmaking.  He's clearly one of the greatest to ever do it.\n\nRating each dream:\n\nSunshine Through The Rain 5/5\nThe Peach Orchard 4/5\nThe Blizzard 5/5\nThe Tunnel 4.5/5\nCrows 4.5/5\nMount Fuji in Red 4.5/5\nThe Weeping Demon 4/5\nVillage of the Watermills 5/5",

The rest of the cast was solid, but he rose above the rest.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool movie with a very basic plot, but for me, it was a great time capsule of 1991.  The film is super stylized with fashion, music, dancing and the vibes of the late 80s/early 90s.  That much really dates the movie, for better or worse.  I for one, loved seeing all this including the adidas tracksuits and gold chains.  And as a huge fan of hip-hop, the soundtrack was greatly enjoyed.\n\nAlthough this movie is very much a product of its time, there's a lot to appreciate.  Seeing Ice-T and Chris Rock in early roles was intriguing enough for me, but then I also got to see where a lot of hip-hop influences/references I knew came from.  The film speaks somewhat thoughtfully about the crack epidemic that was nearly at its worst around that time, which regretfully adds to the time capsule of 1991.",

Any scene with Burns is great, even when God and Jerry Landers (John Denver) are talking, I was totally engaged and found it very interesting.

Unfortunately, the film also has a lot working against it: some terrible performances, some ridiculously poor dancing and moments of unsexiness that really thought they were sexy.\n\nTo me, nothing dragged down the movie more than Elizabeth Berkley's performance which came off as totally amateur.  There were more than a few moments where her delivery was so piss poor I groaned and/or face palmed in awe of how she got here.  It just seemed like she didn't understand how to be a reasonably normal person, and showcased a great disconnection with reality.  She is beautiful though, and a mildly competent dancer.  I wondered if it was the point to get an actor viewers grew up with as an innocent suburban high schooler on Saved By The Bell, and make her into this mature and deeply sexual person.\n\nI mean, I didn't get bored and wanted to see what happened next, but idk if that's all it takes to make a good movie.  Whatever this movie is, I see why it‚Äôs so divisive.  It‚Äôs brilliant and terrible all at once.",

      "Review": "For a movie about and named after Andrei Rublev, there's less of Andrei Rublev than I would have expected.  Rather than a straight up biopic, \"Andrei Rublev\" attempts to navigate spiritual, moral and ethical quandaries within 15th-century Russia.  But for most of the runtime, the film ends up being more about 15th-century Russia than Rublev himself.  Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn) serves mostly as a guide through this landscape as he tries to make sense of faith, sin, art and justice.  \n\nI won't lie, a lot of this went over my head because 1) I know next to nothing about Russian history, which the film sort of expects you to understand, 2) I was constantly confusing characters with one another, and 3) the film operates symbolically so often, and I was already confused so I didn't comprehend much of that in the moment.  Since most of that is personal to me and somewhat lost in translation, I can't fully hold that against the film.\n\nIt's pretty captivating moment to moment even if I didn't always follow it.  The more I let this film sit with me and took time to consider it, the more admiration I had for Andrei Tarkovsky and his craftsmanship.  As far as historical epics go, I prefer this to, something like \"Ben-Hur\" (1959).  There's so much depth to the storytelling I was continually impressed the more I noticed the little details.  This would certainly be rewarding on a rewatch.",

Human ideas (and this film's) are disjointed, overlap and weave together, making it confusing at moments.  I'm sure a lot of this went over my head on this viewing, especially since I couldn't always tell characters apart.  \n\nThe film features some of the most gorgeous camerawork I can remember seeing in a movie.  It's amazing how much Tarkovsky can say without any dialog, some of the most compelling scenes had no talking and sometimes no one on screen.  Is it too obvious to think this is called \"Mirror\" because it's about reflecting on yourself?  \n\nI was fortunate to watch this with a friend who speaks Russian and was able to explain some cultural context that I would've totally missed otherwise.  The poetry shared by the narrator touched on themes of different moments of life, it was often beautiful and occasionally too much for me to grasp.  A second viewing would be more enlightening I'm sure.",

      "Review": "Better than expected, my expectations were deeply low for this film.  When a sequel comes out decades after the original, it's usually bad and often embarrassing.  \n\nI feared it might be one of these long-time coming follow-ups that essentially replaces the original characters with new younger ones, then those new younger ones are given too much screen time and come off as bad parodies of the original.  Despite my doubt, this was not the case with Samara Weaving and Brigette Lundy-Paine, who portray the daughters of Bill & Ted.  At first I did get the feeling of a bad parody, but as it went on their characters were more balanced than I thought and I enjoyed their performances.  Instead of taking over they're given an interesting side plot, while Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) have their own story which occasionally intersects with their daughters.  \n\nIt doesn't feel like too much of a retread and it still keeps the spirit of the series.   On top of that, I found it to be genuinely funny, delivering big laughs and many giggles.  And as was the case with the first two movies in the series, it's very short and was interesting throughout.  \n\nI am so very pleasantly surprised.\n\n",

      "Review": "A complex and layered film about creativity, art, life, death, the passage of time and what‚Äôs really real.  Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a rather tragic character.  Despite his skill, talent and genius, he struggles to handle the most normal parts of life, and on top of that he seems to have terrible luck (which he may or may not have brought on himself).  I empathized with him throughout the film.\n\nThe symbolism and metaphors in this movie range from subtle to overtly literal, like Hazel‚Äôs house which is actually on fire the whole time.  I found the surrealism of this film to be very clever, inventive and one of my favorite aspects of it.  The amount of depth to this script and film is astounding, I‚Äôm continually having revelations about it as time has gone on.  There's poetry in the script, on the screen and in the characters.  It‚Äôs just so well crafted.  It will need to be revisited.  \n",

It allegedly took those five years for mastering and editing, and it kinda shows, this concert film looks and sounds great.  Although their technical ability and dexterity probably doesn‚Äôt match ‚ÄúThe Song Remains the Same‚Äù (1976) when they were in their prime, it‚Äôs still immensely impressive.  When compared to ‚ÄúShine a Light‚Äù (2008), with The Rolling Stones in their later years, Led Zeppelin (despite being broken up for decades) looked similar, if not better, like they hadn‚Äôt missed a step.  \n\nWith such a deep catalog to draw from, it's no surprise this is an effortless watch featuring some of the greatest rock songs ever written.  The energy in the crowd is awesome too, which is no surprise because the tickets were $250, won with a lottery systems, and ‚Äúaccording to Guinness World Records 2009, the concert holds the world record for the ‚ÄòHighest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert‚Äô as 20 million requests for the reunion show were rendered online.‚Äù\n\nIt is a bummer that John Bonham is dead and couldn‚Äôt be there, but his son Jason Bonham holds it down as the drummer.  The rest of them just kick ass, it‚Äôs really cool to see this legendary concert in such high quality.  I expect to rewatch this many times.  \n",

      "Review": "If you thought Charlie Kaufmans other films were confusing, get ready for the most confusing yet.  A film that unapologetically explains nothing.  Which I think, is for the best, as exposition would‚Äôve cheapened the movie.\n\n\"I'm Thinking of Ending Things\" is very thoughtful and super poetic.  The script is filled with philosophical discussions, critiques of art, somber reflections and actual poems.  It‚Äôs a lot to take in, especially as what‚Äôs happening on screen is strange and confusing upon the initial viewing.  It‚Äôs sad in ways I didn‚Äôt expect.  Even when I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening, there were still uncomfortable feelings in the air.\n\nBy the end it certainly seemed that the film is about Jake reflecting on his life, things he did wrong, things he didn‚Äôt do, and what could‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ as he thinks about ending things.  But there‚Äôs still more to it.  There was a line early on about how movies are dangerous, like ideas, they grow in your head.  Then there‚Äôs a lot of references and discussions about movies within the movie.  It seems that Jake, later in his life, lets ideas in his head grow, whether it be the plot of a Robert Zemeckis movie or a moment in his life - those ideas grow, intersect, overlap and merge with one another.  Like other Kaufman projects, real events, thoughts and memories all exist on screen and we aren‚Äôt always told how to identify what is what.  But idk, I thought it was cool.",

There's definitely some interesting tidbits I didn't know about this story.  The creator of Pepe is such a regular dude,  though I felt like I could relate to him in moments, his segments were largely uninteresting.  \n\nMost of all it's good to know the creators intent behind Pepe was purely wholesome fun, so with a guilt free conscience I can keep using Pepe and saying \"Feels Good Man.\"",

      "Review": "Men wearing women's clothing is nothing new, nor was it in 1995.  It goes back hundreds of years.  When looking at other movies featuring men in drag, like ‚ÄúSome Like It Hot‚Äù (1959), the fact men were in drag was often the joke.  In ‚ÄúTo Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar‚Äù the jokes aren‚Äôt usually about drag, and they‚Äôre being made by the drag queens, and it‚Äôs never in poor taste.  These jokes are just funny, witty and snappy.  It feels surprisingly woke for a movie from the 90‚Äôs.  \n\nThe performances from the three leads (Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze, and John Leguizamo) were hilarious and heartfelt at the same time.  These queens are strong, proud and unapologetic for who they are, and they almost exclusively spread joy to anyone willing to spend a moment with them.  Other than the very first scene in the film, they never come out of drag, which was a great call.  We get to experience this beautiful transformation for the full runtime.  They portray these queens with sincerity and depth that ranges from sassy to jovial.  \n\nOn one level, the film humanizes drag queens to anyone who may find that strange or off putting.  And for those of us who were already fully accepting of them, it just shows how drag queens empower others and lift the spirits of those around them.  It‚Äôs a story about love, friendship and how your life can be more fabulous than you ever thought.  Even if the script isn‚Äôt poetic or anything like that, it‚Äôs still really funny, and totally sincere with a touching story that had me smiling the whole time.  By the end, it was a bit cliche, but I still found it endearing and emotionally moving.  Overall, much more fun than I expected to have, and so many amazing outfits.\n\n‚ÄúLittle latin boy in drag, why are you crying?‚Äù",

      "Review": "So you know how it takes a bit of time to walk an entire mile, and movies usually think not to show the full drawn out jaunt, because you can easily imagine how it would happen - B√©la Tarr said fuck that.  Could we imply drunken escapades at the town's bar in a short scene? Yes, but we could also show those intoxicated dances and tomfoolery in a lengthy uncut shot as the drunken exuberance peaks and declines naturally.  The film's epic 432 minute runtime is surely its most notable feature.  The story however isn‚Äôt as epic, not to say it‚Äôs not great, but it could be told in the length of a standard feature - but clearly that‚Äôs not the point.  \n\nI‚Äôd guess at least half of ‚ÄúS√°t√°ntang√≥‚Äù is filled with no dialog, there‚Äôs many scenes where you truly experience the journey of different characters.  Oftentimes the point we‚Äôre hammering home with those long scenes is how shitty the lives of these people are.  They‚Äôre often forced to walk miles in the dark and/or in the rain.  They have little to no sources for information.  They‚Äôre mostly alcoholics with (what seems like) poor nutrition.  Specifically seeing the doctor struggle to do the simplest things (like getting in and out of bed, and getting more alcohol) can be quite heartbreaking.  The whole film really shows how desperate for any kind of hope people from intensely impoverished areas can be.  Some places in the world are just very bleak and there‚Äôs no way around that. \n\nDespite many interesting elements, the film got boring frequently and I struggle with whether to consider that a knock against the film, or if it‚Äôs a positive because that was the point?  Still not sure I have an answer to that, it goes back to appreciating a film versus enjoying it.  ‚ÄúS√°t√°ntang√≥‚Äù is definitely an experience for any film fan.  Its pacing is consistent, if nothing else.  What‚Äôs cool is it‚Äôs really meant to be experienced as one film, despite being over seven hours.  It‚Äôs not meant to be a mini-series or anything like that, it‚Äôs really just one big story of the people in this town.  On top of all this and the general uniqueness of the film, it‚Äôs super well made, polished and crisp in its presentation.  Truly a feat of filmmaking.  ",

With new interviews, studio chatter, remastered (?) footage of their touring performances and showcasing the general shenanigans of The Beatles, I found this doc to be a fun and easy viewing experience.  It's got a nice style, was informative, and features The Beatles, so with that much I was sold.\n\nIt does a great job putting into perspective the escapade these touring years were and why they understandably had to stop touring.",

      "Review": "A well shot film with beautiful scenery of the American countryside. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway both deliver great performances as a couple deeply in love who are also okay with murdering people and stealing money and cars.  Bonnie and Clyde are the type of people who live in the moment and rarely think about an exit strategy to their lifestyle.  It's the kind of thing that's quite exciting in the moment, but when the dust settles they are constantly left with the thought of \"now what?\"  \n\nI'm not sure how much of this really happened, I imagine a lot of it didn't.   What's important is that during the Great Depression in the US, Bonnie and Clyde were a symbol of regular people taking what's theirs from a government that let them down - or something like that, idk. \n\nThis was really good.",

      "Review": "People will be mad at this rating, but it‚Äôs the right one.  Borat takes an honest look at the USA in 2006.  Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) himself has very archaic beliefs, but he also appears friendly and sincere which allows the people on camera to believe this is real.  The ideas Borat has aren‚Äôt unheard of, you could believe someone somewhere in the world thinks similar to this.   Sacha Baron Cohen‚Äôs ability to push Borat's values and ideology one step beyond what could be real for someone from an uneducated and impoverished area is much of the film's brilliance. \n\nThe story isn‚Äôt so much about Borat, as it is how people react to a man of this character, for better or worse.  Most are a bit confused and bewildered by him, but many still show compassion and acceptance.  Some use Borat as a mirror to reveal their own racist, homophobic, xenophobic and antisemetic views.  And though Borat has those bigoted viewpoints, the fact he speaks Hebrew throughout the film, and Baron Cohen himself is jewish, shows how very in on the joke he is. \n\nSacha Baron Cohen puts on a great performance as the titular character, his ability to stay straight and in character during the movie's most ridiculous moments showcases his skill.  The fact he‚Äôs such a good actor makes this work all the more.  \n\nSimply put, this is one of the funniest movies I‚Äôve ever seen in my life.  I‚Äôm still laughing all these years later.  Sometimes it‚Äôs Borat's lines/delivery and sometimes it's the real reactions from people.  At 86 minutes and just enough story to tie it all together, you can see how this film became a cultural icon and its influence can still be seen to this day.",

Not only did it keep me guessing til the very end, but in retrospect all the clues were so obvious pointing the killer.  It has hilarious moments poking fun at the genre, and still understands how to be terrifying.  As someone who hasn't seen too much horror, this may have pulled me in deeper.\n\n\"It's the millennium.

It‚Äôs a well tangled and interweaving plot that kept me guessing and asking questions, with satisfying results.\n\nAs a neo-noir movie with jazz and Denzel Washington, I was sure to like this to some degree, but I was even more enthralled than expected.  Truly a hidden gem, it seems like this should have more acclaim than it does.  Even though this was a box office failure, I guess I can see why, but it saddens me. The studio optioned two more Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins films, and the author wrote many more, I wish we got those.\n\nMemorable characters, great performances from actors I‚Äôve never seen and obviously Denzel is perfect, and was my main motivation for watching tbh.

This film was made in 1944 and takes place in 1904, an idyllic era of St. Louis, for some.   The story itself felt somewhat inconsequential and tbf I didn't fully follow it, what I gathered is it follows various relationships at different stages.  It's also about finding out the treasure you seek may be under your nose all along - in this case the city of St. Louis... or not maybe I missed the point.\n \nThere's a few musical numbers that stood out as particularly great - 'The Trolley Song' comes to mind.  I also love how these early color movies really make the most of it and show a wide spread of varied colors.  Judy Garland at one point is wearing a dress that looks like a highlighter which highlights this fact.  Judy herself is lovely in the lead role - confident, beautiful, on point and sounding good. \n\nAlso I always forget how hard people used to be back in the day.  It seems people get softer every generation.  These little kids were talking about stabbing, strangling, starting huge fires in the middle of their neighborhood and throwing flour at people who answer their door... I was like \"damn\".",

It has you accept some hard truths and also feel somewhat hopeful and inspired by the end (in theory).  The film certainly has a point to make; that revolutionary ideas and actions, however well meaning, are usually an uphill battle and the government that‚Äôs supposed to protect you will often actively work against you.  Still, the film feels like a by-the-numbers courtroom drama, often being dull and unimaginative despite the story itself being sensational.\n\nThe movie flows pretty smoothly, which isn‚Äôt surprising considering Sorkin is the writer.  The dialog flows effortlessly and is unsurprisingly the film's strongest element.  Some of the editing is kind of clever, but most of the film beyond that is unexceptional.  Despite some dark subject matter, I dare say this a 'feel good movie'.  It‚Äôs meant to tell us that those who appear the most radical are sometimes the most woke and it ends in a hopeful manner, albeit distinctly cheesy.\n\nReally makes you think about how many times people got fucked over in ‚Äúfair‚Äù trials throughout American history.",

That's cool, same-sex marriage was legally-recognized in 2015 nationwide, so it's not a problem.\"  But in 1996 it was not the case.  \n\nThe film has fun with (but also provides commentary on) the mannerisms, posture, and language used by gay men versus straight men.  It was a wildly scandalous concept at the time, but much of this is still a worthy conversation today.  \n\nRobin Williams and Nathan Lane are hysterical in the lead roles.   They often made me burst out laughing with one look or one line.  The production design is awesome too, it's very colorful without just being a rainbow.   I can see why this has rewatchability.

      "Review": "Sadly, this is simply not as funny as the original, but not a total waste of time.  As the film addresses, the character of Borat has become way too iconic for Sacha Baron Cohen to make a movie like the first one.  Instead, he cleverly focuses much of the film on his daughter, Tutar Sagdiyev (Maria Bakalova), which also allows the film to explore new topics.  Despite not being super funny, it was still an easy watch for me, and Baron Cohen is funny enough that his offhanded comments still got me laughing sometimes.  We see Borat and his daughter tackle new and old issues, which often showcases the ignorance of Americans, and sometimes their good hearts.  \n\nBorat himself will always entertain me.  The character is too infectious.  It doesn't reach the heights of the original, but it doesn't feel like a total retread.  Even though I completely despise the Trump administration, I must admit the film is incredibly slanted, and is nearly just an ad for Joe Biden (for better or worse).\n\nWaWaWeeWa, go vote!",

With a unique concept, great performances, excellent atmosphere and sharp filmmaking this concert film works so well.  Weirdly enough, starring Dane DeHaan as a roadie for Metallica.  The film partially follows him on an incredibly violent, fiery and chaotic journey running an errand for the band mid concert.  It cuts between that, and the actual concert, which is filmed in Vancouver, and awesome within itself.  The scenes with DeHaan match the energy of the concert nicely. \n\nJames Hetfield's vocals are on point and have not aged.  Kirk Hammett showcases his virtuosic guitar skills, playing arpeggios in the blink of an eye.  Robert Trujillo is a wizard on the bass, playing smooth, fast and powerfully.  Lars Ulrich sued Napster and his own fans for that matter, but he's still really good at playing the drums.\n\nDespite not being the biggest fan of Metallica, I loved this concert.  It's all just so metal.  Wooooo Metallica!!!!  ü§ò",

The film waxes poetic about isolation, temptation, longing, memory and love - how it can come and go, or not.  Some of the best moments of the film are these elegant and inspired montages of the characters in pensive reflection.  The camera slowly moves by them with music and no dialog.  You always know what they're thinking about in those moments and the films sense of style is on full display. \n\nWhat sticks with me most is the wall between Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) and Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu‚Äëwai).  Obviously that is frequently a metaphorical wall that holds back their relationship.  Sometimes it's the physical wall between their apartments.  In those moments I felt sorrow for their solitude and loneliness - knowing how happy they could be in that moment if they were to come together.  Still, you understand they cannot for various reasons.  \n\nI also found it interesting the film begins with their meeting and doesn't really give you a chance to meet their spouses.  Which made me want them to link up even more, with little guilt.  \n\nEven though Wong Kar-wai's movies may not be for everyone, this one is so slick and smooth in it's execution, you gotta respect it.",

      "Review": "An in depth, fascinating, and sometimes disheartening documentary.  It's about how those in power use psychology to influence and steer the general public into doing what they think is best (maybe for the greater good of the country but more likely) for their own selfish and monetary reasons.  We learn how advertisers, PR firms, and politicians have been using psychological principles developed by Sigmund Freud and (his nephew) Edward Bernays to increase sales, influence and manipulate the larger population for decades.\n\nThough this story obviously ends in 2002, it allowed me to draw many of my own conclusions about how these concepts affected events that were yet to come, like: the Iraq war, the social media boom and the rise of Donald Trump as a politician.  By speaking to people's innermost desires (that they themselves may not even understand,) you can accomplish quite a lot with the right platform.\n\nAlthough it lacks style and can be pretty repetitive, this doc is still worthwhile.  It makes you think more about how so much of what you see in the world is actively trying to influence you (and the greater population) to the whims of the rich and powerful.  Much of this I already knew, or suspected, but its articulated well here by Adam Curtis and the interviewees.",

Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker) isn't a literal samurai, but he embodies the mindset and lifestyle of one.  Despite having moments of action, \"Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai\" is mostly a meditative movie that gave me plenty of peaceful reflection.  A state of mind I enjoyed.\n\nI had misconceptions before seeing this and thought it would be a dumb movie because the title seemed silly.  By the end, I felt quite the opposite, and thought Jim Jarmusch showed a lot of respect and understanding of classic samurai cinema.  Having seen many classic samurai films, including \"Rashomon\" (1950), which is touched on here, it actually feels like Ghost Dog fits right in with those classics.\n\n---\n\n‚ÄúThere is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything.‚Äù\n-Yamamoto Tsunetomo",

This musical tells a story about connections, whether they be in your brain, between people in the room, between people in a city, or all across the country.  As time goes by some of these connections get lost, for better or worse, but that's what makes us us.  Byrne and company show this through song, dance and the style of the stage they perform on.  It's effortlessly enjoyable and has good points to make along the way.  Like other projects of Byrne this feels welcoming, warm, charming and just fun while still making the occasional political or social statement.  Byrne has a great understanding of music and (it would seem) human nature, as well.\n\nByrne's singing also seems to just get better over the years.",

It's an interesting concept to see vampires living in the modern day without it being a loud action film.  These vampires have been alive for hundreds of years and are jaded to the modern day.  They've used their time to gain immense skill and knowledge which they use to amuse themselves and give a reason to live.  It's a very meandering and melancholy film with characters talking frequently in monotone.  It makes you wonder if living forever is all it's cracked up to be, or if you might get board of life and earth.\n\nSo many of these shots are so well constructed.

At 98 mins the film mostly flies by but began to wear on me by the 3rd act, especially the fantasy dance number that felt shoehorned in - that seems to be common for the era and genre.\n\nMovies like \"On The Town\" that just feature friends on an adventure through the city is a winning formula for me.  Frank Sinatra has a shining charisma to him, and a Gene Kelly is the human equivalent of a wink.  Ann Miller, Betty Garrett and co are really great at dancing and move with grace.

Without spoiling too much, Orson Welles has a great understanding of psychology and how it can lead a person to make decisions that are, at the least, ambiguously evil.  Welles humanizes the villains to the point you can understand their logic, as twisted as it is, and might even empathize with them. \n\nOn top of all that, the film is masterfully shot, telling stories within the frame and just showing off some artistic craftsmanship.  The film creates a perfect atmosphere for its mood.  More-so, the reconstruction really shows how Welles is a master of cinema, lots of great ideas in here.\n\nCharlton Heston playing a Mexican is not cool, and he isn't even remotely convincing as a Mexican.  That whitewashing is quite distracting, but the rest of the movie is so good it is able to mostly overcome this.",

Though the plot is overly complex and there's a few issues outside of that, it's incredibly well thought out and pristine in appearance.  The music, the cinematography and the environments look grand and give the film Nolan's recognizable bold presentation.  \n\nRobert Pattinson is great at acting.

Not that this has completely changed, but we've come a long way.\n\nIt's interesting to see the lengths some people will go to be a winner - for better or worse.  Sometimes their (Steve Wiebe) passion and dedication is admirable, and sometimes it just comes off as sociopathic and cowardly (Billy Mitchell).  You can apply this to much bigger events in the world and history.\n\nI really enjoyed just reminiscing on what it meant to be a nerd/geek in 2006 and thinking about how much this culture has changed.  But underneath it all, it is a very human story about gaming, redemption, passion and community.  Would def recommend this to gamers of all time periods.  ",

This is something I find admirable; those artists who do it to do it, not for what it will bring them.\n\nWhen it comes to obscure music, it's cool how the vast majority of people can have no idea who an artist is, but that artist can still mean so much to the people who know.  This film takes that idea to an extreme.  Without spoiling too much, it just makes me think about how much great music gets lost or doesn't get celebrated for whatever reason, but it can still be as poetic and brilliant as music made by the superstars of the time.",

Voguing and 'throwing shade' both came out of that, and even more elements of the culture I wasn't familiar with.  It's so sad how tragic life was for those who were LGBTQ in the past, not that it's easy now, but it was downright awful how these people were treated by those outside their community.  Hence the need for a community.  This drag-ball scene meant a lot to all these people, as it was the place they could be who they were on the inside, while expressing themselves and being celebrated for that by their peers.  \n\nThe film certainly notes the horrific things all these people experienced for being gay/trans or in drag.  But it mostly uses it's time to show how fabulous, hilarious and talented this community was - or that's at least what stuck with me.  Many of the people featured here expressed their desires to be larger than life, famous, models and movie stars... how appropriate it is that this films legacy is now legendary and widely celebrated.",

      "Review": "Sergio Leone was able to make this a fun movie while still having a grounded and serious message.  \"Duck, You Sucker\" aka \"Once Upon a Time... The Revolution\" aka \"A Fistful of Dynamite\" has the highest bodycount of any of Leone's movies.  That is notable because it gives off early action movie vibes, but also exemplifies how tragic war can be, even if it's in the name of revolution.  Though the film has emotional depth to it, it's also somewhat cartoony in moments, which gave me many laughs and smiles.  We maybe didn't need those flashback scenes, but they served a purpose and weren't going to ruin the movie.  Overall, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one, I think it gets a bad rap because it doesn't match the tone of Leone's more lauded films, but in many ways, that was for the best.\n\n\"A Fistful of Dynamite\" is the best name btw.",

      "Review": "As much as I appreciate the references to 1930s Hollywood and nods to \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) itself, \"Mank\" was often boring.  The film is sometimes too full of itself, making cracks about old school Hollywood, politics of the time and dropping timely pop culture references.  Although I appreciated the wittiness and career of the character of Herman 'Mank' Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), I wasn't really invested in him or rooting for him.\n\nWhat the film maybe does best is making its presentation emulate a film from the time.  It's not just that it's in black and white, but the score and entire presentation of the film goes out of its way to resemble filmmaking of the time.  As a big fan of Orson Welles, the subtle odes to \"Citizen Kane\" itself were cool to see - those parodying of certain shots was neat.\n\nAnd again, the dialog in the film is often witty, but sometimes it just feels a bit full of itself, like it just wants to show off how clever it can be.  It also felt like a very slanted telling of this story.  Accounts vary as to how much work Welles did versus Mank for the script, but the film leans fully into the the stories that Mank did all of the work and it went uncelebrated.  In the end, \"Mank\" has a lot to admire, but it just wasn't the smooth experience I was hoping for. ",

      "Review": "A film that does so much right, but it doesn't all come together.  This Robin Hood tale works to some degree, but it doesn't spend enough time justifying that logic.  There's some great scenes where Frank White (Christopher Walken) explains his motivations and rationale for killing who he does, or perpetrating the crimes he does, but those scenes don't come frequent enough.   Walken is great in the lead role, being calm and cool with his more sinister nature bubbling beneath the surface.  \n\nIt's also more well shot than I expected, playing with shadows, smoke and the lights of NY.  But to me, the tone wasn't consistent throughout the film.   Even though it was quite exciting during the action scenes, the plot overall wasn't airtight.  \n\nIt definitely works as a gangster flick.  Some of these characters are so cold blooded.  I must've thought \"that's some gangster shit\" to myself at least twenty times watching this.  ",

The original runtime was 155 minutes and it got cut down to 86 minutes, so you can imagine how it suffered.  Regardless, the movie we have available to us is still pretty good.  Welles has such an  innovative style, it's really cool to see in the 1940's.

This is a documentary that champions immigrants of the country, their contributions and how the American dream can be real...  something we need to hear in the modern day.  It reminds us that even the most saintly people are flawed like all of us, but it doesn't take away from their accomplishments and/or good deeds.  The doc can be dull and repetitive in moments, but it certainly worked for me overall, and I liked the design of cartoon story-telling segments.\n\nIt also, more obviously, celebrates donuts, how great they are and how they evolved with culture over time.  It will certainly leave you wanting to find some donuts soon after the credits roll.  Not that anyone cares, but if you asked me my favorite donut, I would tell you I like a variety, but I might say glazed if you pressured me.\n\nAnd a big shoutout to Cambodian Americans in general.

      "Review": "The story is taken from famed playwright August Wilson.  Thanks to him, the script shines with characters talking jive, roasting each other, considering their place/role in society, dreaming bigger and generally waxing poetic.  This can range from humorous to profound to poignant.  It is very heavy on dialog, and I found myself tuning out for extended periods, as some of the dialog seemed dull and wasn't gripping.\n\nThough it‚Äôs pretty good looking most of the time, it still has that look of a streaming movie where it plateaus at a point, like they just didn‚Äôt use high end equipment.  But maybe not, I‚Äôm no expert.   \n\nIt‚Äôs a sad, but very real story we‚Äôve heard before so many times.  Black people being used by the white man to make a buck while stealing their art.  Some, like Ma Rainey, learn how to use their skills as bargaining tools to extract respect, money and whatever they want from the white businessmen.   Others go about it more bluntly.  \n\nSurely Chadwick Boseman‚Äôs performance will be the most talked about aspect of the film, for obvious reasons, and mostly because he is so fucking good here.  The role allows for some great acting opportunities and he knocks it out of the park more than once.  I expect he‚Äôll posthumously win an Oscar for this, and rightfully so.\n",

Filled with references to other movies, and countless cameos from big time movie stars, which is cool to see in itself.  Beyond that it's sort of about corruption and weirdly a detective story.  But the character arc of Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is the real story.  Hollywood is a town of haves and have nots, and you can lose your soul and humanity in it.  The plot is pretty compelling throughout even if the main character is not admirable.

Every time the family ran into one of these \"hillbillies\" I expected the hillbillies to be mean, sneaky or hateful.  Instead they usually end up being helpful while showing love and compassion, even if it's slightly misguided in moments.  Which made me feel like the ignorant one.  \n\nGrowing up most of my friends were/are first generation Americans.  This film gets a lot right about that experience - ignorant (usually harmless) questions from white people (me), specialty food stores, ingredients I've never heard of, unique smells, parents with thick accents and kids that sound extra American.\n\nFill with symbolism, humor, simple yet beautiful landscapes and touching moments, \"Minari\" has a lot to offer and plenty to say.

The slightest bit of inhumanity would be enough to break this blanket of cordialness.  Though the protagonists in \"The Ladykillers\" are dastardly gentlemen, it is hilariously tame by today's standards.  \n\nThe film didn't get many laughs out of me.  In fact, almost none.  It's this concept you've seen of \"we have to act like things are normal, even though they clearly aren't.\"  It probably worked better in a more gracious time.  Still it's a short breezy movie with plenty of tomfoolery and a varied cast of characters.  Katie Johnson plays one of the sweetest old ladies I've seen on film, and you have to sympathize with her.  She keeps the film morally grounded opposite the five caricature criminals.  Overall I enjoyed the wackiness and the ending was on point, so I can say this is good.",

      "Review": "With few words, \"Lessons of Darkness\" tells its story very effectively.  Sometimes you don't need all the gritty details to know how impactful an event was to a place.  Just seeing a previously thriving Kuwait turned into hell on earth is moving enough.  Werner Herzog couples this with sweeping cinematic shots and a robust soundtrack.  Sprinkle in short poetic narrations, the people of the land and the emotion creates itself.  \n\nPerfectly timed at 54 mins, it wasn't as depressing as I thought it might be.  Despite this being a tragic and villainous moment in time, it comes off as more of an honest reflection rather than trying to make you sad.  Herzog somehow finds the devilish beauty in this dark moment in time.",

      "Review": "A great man once said \"It always seems impossible until it's done,\" something Fitzcarraldo (Klaus Kinski) surely thought to himself as he pursued his grand dream.  Fitzcarraldo is the kind of person who is a visionary only because he has a large supply of money, which wasn't really earned.  In some sense he reminds me of an entitled child of a billionaire who thinks being a film director, senator or CEO are reasonable career aspirations.  They are actually stupendously ambitious goals, but privilege has led them to think otherwise.  Fitzcarraldo's spirit and fortitude are strong enough that I still found him admirable. \n\nFitzcarraldo wanted to build his own opera house in the middle of the Amazon.  So he sets out on this epic adventure while rarely thinking about the specific steps needed to realize his goals.  Not realizing the massive undertaking his plans are, he often celebrates a moment too soon.  Choosing to live in the moment of accomplishment or day dream about having his own opera house, rather than work on a long term plan\n\nThere's a ton of comparisons to be made to \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), but this is distinct enough it doesn't feel like a copy.  The film works so well because of how Werner Herzog insisted on filming everything for real (which caused issues behind the scenes, you may know about).  That decision pays off big time, with shot after shot being immensely beautiful and making the adventure feel so real you can smell it.  ",

With thoughts like \"Is there such a thing as insanity in a penguin?\" he takes a look at the life on Antartica in a way few would.  Werner Herzog always seems to find interesting people who have crazy stories or distinctive perspectives.  The interviews with these individuals make up some of the most interesting parts of the doc.  \n\nUsually a nature doc shines brightest with its imagery, and there's some gorgeous shots here, but I especially appreciate how Herzog is able to find the absurdity of life in these situations.  I can't tell if he's funny on purpose or unintentionally, but either way there are some honestly hilarious moments in this film.  In a way only Herzog can, he elevates this doc from just being about the arctic landscape and life to something special.",

At least a third of this movie is just dancing, often times John Waters has the music playing very low and you mostly hear the sounds of peoples feet shuffling and tapping on the floor - a very particular choice that pays off.  The dancing itself isn't intensely impressive, but it is most certainly contagiously fun.  \n\nThe story goes in a direction I wasn't expecting, but it works out for the best.  The most notable trait of the film might be the style of the world.  It takes place in the 1960s, but feels like the way you might dream about that time, rather than how it truly was.  This larger-than-life style really makes the movie distinct and memorable.  I can see why this was adapted into a musical, it almost feels weird that it isn't one.\n\nThough it defies expectations, the plot still feels quite linear.  But with a short runtime of 92 mins, this watch is a breeze, and a fun time.",

This story would probably remain powerful if Dieter Dengler just sat in an empty room and told his story, but obviously Herzog is going to do more.  He takes us through Dieter Dengler's life at the current moment, then literally retraces his steps as a POW during the Vietnam War.  You can see what a strong person Dieter is, as he takes us through this insanely traumatic time in his life with ease and a straightforward matter-of-factness.\n\nDieter Dengler and Werner Herzog seem like they could have been brothers separated at birth.  It's like when you see a director cast someone who is very reminiscent of themselves as the protagonist.  I'm sure Herzog found Dieter very easy to work with.  They were both born in Germany around the same time, both are very pragmatic people and know how to tell a story.\n\nLike I said, Dieter's story is incredibly compelling and just miraculous.  Herzog brings Dieter back to the locations and surroundings Dieter lived through in the Air Force and as a POW, like a real life PowerPoint presentation.  You can't help but be drawn in.\n\nOne of Herzog's best docs, this is a story for the ages.",

It's horrendous how commonplace it is (and has been) for men to be predatory or at least aggressively pursue sex (with women, in this case).  Obviously, this has always been immoral, but with the #MeToo movement and such, it‚Äôs much more in the public discourse these days.  ‚ÄúPromising Young Woman‚Äù is about a woman getting revenge against men for this behavior, and not just one man, but men in general (and those who enable that behavior).  Because of this, I suspect men will rate this film lower than women, because they will feel attacked (and kinda have it coming tbh).\n\nThe cinematography and production design is stunning.  All the costumes, songs and sets felt very specifically chosen and give the movie a lot to stand on, even if the story wasn‚Äôt compelling.  But this story is very compelling.  I went the whole movie without pausing.  It jumps between thriller and rom-com, but the thrilling elements kept me fully engaged and I needed to see what happened next.  There‚Äôs a lot I would like to say about the story, but I‚Äôd rather not allude to anything about it that might even hint at a spoiler.  Some of the choices are quite bold for better or worse.  \n\nOverall, it‚Äôs very cool, poignant and exciting.  Easily one of the years best.",

Although the movie is unambitious and predictable, it still got a couple good laughs out of me.  I thought the story was a somewhat interesting way to explore neanderthals evolving during a pivotal moment in human history.  It's about the benefits of taking risks and trying new things.  Nothing special, it is a by-the-numbers animated family flick, but an easy watch. ",

      "Review": "On the simplest level - after watching 30 episodes of Twin Peaks (1990-1991) in standard definition and a 4:3 aspect ratio, it was so satisfying to see this world on film, in widescreen high definition.  ‚ÄúTwin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me‚Äù cuts out the fat of the TV show - it doesn‚Äôt have those threads that don‚Äôt matter and low quality soap-opera meandering romances.  The film has time to address some of Laura‚Äôs romances, but it‚Äôs to juxtapose them and show the unbalanced life of her character - not to keep you tuned in until next time (which is one of my main gripes with television).  Lynch makes it abundantly clear this is a movie and not an extended episode of TV; we get crisper filmmaking, higher caliber acting and a full original soundtrack (which may be the best work of long-time David Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti).\n\nIt felt a bit weird to see some actors replaced, or seeing Special Agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland) take a storyline that seemed like it was meant for Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan).  Nevertheless, they were both fine, and it was interesting to expand the Twin Peaks universe and get a better understanding of how the FBI agents in this world operate.  I really enjoyed seeing Gordon Cole (David Lynch) introduce them to a character early on and then seeing them decode it like they‚Äôre interpreting a David Lynch movie.  \n\nLike other David Lynch movies there are visual motifs, lots of symbolic statements and plenty of surrealism, which often make his films mysteries to be solved.  The poetic nature of films like these create some powerful moments on screen when the dialog drops, the music turns up and we‚Äôre left to take in what is being seen.  \n\nThere are some loose threads, a mysterious brief appearance from David Bowie, and some characters we don‚Äôt see at all.  But I‚Äôd rather keep this movie to an acceptable length, so I can‚Äôt fault them too much for not touching on every bit of lore in the series.  Overall it‚Äôs really nice to see the character of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) alive and walking around after just hearing stories of her for 30 episodes.  Lee herself gives an incredible performance, which made the story engrossing and drives the whole movie.\n\nTwin Peaks gives us an old school detective experience through the eyes of David Lynch.  He likes to take concepts we are familiar with and twist them up and turn them upside down, which is always interesting.  Twin Peaks is no exception.  In addition to the mystery the detectives have to solve, Lynch similarly presents us with a movie/show to be decoded - and, oh, it works so well. ",

It‚Äôs about how these corporations use technology for all the wrong reasons and rarely address the human component of the problems they face. \n\nSome of the acting is a bit unbalanced and/or over-the-top, though it‚Äôs kinda covered up by the fact this is a satire, which you may or may not consider a fair critique.\n\nAnd if you don't care about any of the deeper meaning to the story, it is just awesome to see RoboCop blow shit up and kick ass.",

More importantly, it‚Äôs great to have this moment in time captured, and seeing how important it was for Jay-Z and hip-hop itself.\n\nIn the film it‚Äôs implied that this is the first time a hip-hop act played Madison Square Garden, but if you ask Google, it was Travis Scott, so I looked on Wikipedia and it seems The Beastie Boys did it first.  But the point still stands, that MSG rarely let acts like Jay-Z perform, for whatever reason, which makes this feel like a big cultural moment for the hip-hop community.  \n\nYou might be delighted to know there are appearances from Kanye West, Beyonce, Rick Rubin and even Memphis Bleek is more present than you might think. \n\nAlthough this film is getting a 3.5/5, Jay-Z himself gets a 5/5.  He's such a smart and savvy person with great stage presence and thoughtful lyrics. Even his narration worked really well, I thought  (other than the silliness of this being a retirement).  There‚Äôs so much good footage here, but the direction is pretty thoughtless - it feels like this could have just been made in iMovie.  The filmmaking itself is lacking in style.  This could benefit from being remastered, considering the wealth of content.  \n\nWe see a lot of audience shots which capture this specific moment in time and all the glory of the style and fashion of 2003.  Most importantly, Jay-Z is so good at rapping, and it‚Äôs always great to see a master at work.  ",

Like many martial arts films, \"Fist of Legend\" is about honor, respect, but it's also about patriotism and racism, weirdly enough.

Certainly one of Jet Li's best. ",

There's enough of a story to tie it all together nicely, though I doubted some of the historical accuracy and ages of characters.\n\nIt's an easy breezy watch that ended up being quite satisfying by the end.

Lynch believes explaining the mystery ruins the mystery, and he‚Äôs not wrong.  \n\nAfter seeing 48 episodes, 1 movie and 1 semi-movie, I think I have some good guesses and theories as to what‚Äôs going on in Twin Peaks.  But to simply explain what the show is all about, would not be simple.  It‚Äôs all buried in symbolism, metaphors and cinematic poetry.  One thing I have gathered to be a consistent theme is; the rippling effect and echoes of evil events over time.  Whether that moment be a nuclear bomb or a brutal murder of a nice young teenage girl.  Though our hero Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is the epitome of good, and I love him.  The show consistently explores the dichotomy between good and evil.  Similarly wood and fire are two repeated symbols in the show, maybe to compare structure and growth with chaos and destruction, but idk.  \n\nThe show is constantly fun on a surface level like the story with Janey-E Jones and Dougie Jones, which provided many laughs.  This is complimented by the heady David Lynch abstract storytelling, like Part 8, which truly had me in awe for that entire hour.  Twin Peaks explores that whole spectrum, making it varied and continually intriguing. \n\nMany call this a series, though it‚Äôs referred to as ‚ÄòA Limited Event Series,‚Äô and sometimes it is called a film.  But that is another debate.  Whatever it was, that shit was amazing. I'm proud to be a David Lynch completionist now, and can‚Äôt wait to see what he does next.  ",

Creating many parallels to the life of the author, William S. Burroughs, it's all quite clever and makes the movie a unique experience. \n\nIt's about Bill's (Peter Weller) journey to becoming writer - told in a very indirect way.  Filled with hallucinations, \"Naked Lunch\" carries an impressive style to it that tells its story through projections and takes us to strange places which is really all in his mind.  Meanwhile Peter Weller's face the whole movie looks like he's so high and strung out which is, in turn, maybe the realest part of the experience.  \n\nI loved the surrealist nature of the film and how David Cronenberg still included plenty of the words and wisdom of Burroughs himself.",

For me it was super relatable and felt pretty realistic, albeit a crazy ass night.  Made the careers of so many people.  I love it so.  \n\nOh and that soundtrack, flawless!",

      "Review": "One of the most racist and uncomfortable viewing experiences I've ever had, only made acceptable by the context and knowing Spike Lee is the writer/director.  Even still, I found the film to be quite funny in moments.  At its heart this is a satire.  \n\nBlack people (and others) have been exploited and dehumanized for entertainment for the entire history of film.  \"Bamboozled\" is a film that puts that in your face and reminds you everyone was compliant with blackface and these deeply racist depictions of black folk.\n\nWhen it comes to the \"Mantan\" show itself, Lee really made it as racist as possible.  Every little detail of the characters, costumes and sets are drenched with the racist history of our entertainment.  At the same time, the production value in those moments and the choreography is kind of amazing.  I found it particularly clever that those were the only moments shot on 16mm, while the rest of the film was shot on digital. \n\nSavionn Glover (who plays Manray) is one of the best tap dancers in the world, and Spike Lee wrote the movie for him.  Seeing his skills in action is really impressive, but all the racist iconography creates an intense conflict in my mind - which is kind of the point. \n\nI was dazzled, astonished and uncomfortable at the same time.  As Spike Lee surely intended, by the end, it seems clear we have all been bamboozled.",

      "Review": "In the middle of the movie we see Michael Jordan for about two seconds, speak the titular words; \"He Got Game.\"  These three words say more than any scouting report or statistics could.  If the best player in the world thinks you have game, you're gonna go far, and you don't need any more approval.\n\nJesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen) is genuinely a good person.  He doesn't fit the mold of what you might expect from a young basketball prospect.  He won't take any bribes, gifts or favors - yet some part of me expected him to eventually.  Although he is above those unethical practices, we still see what the recruitment process is like in reality, which is far from altruistic.  \n\nDenzel is obviously incredible in his role, you didn't need me to tell you that.  I found it interesting that Spike Lee chose to cast a real baller to play Jesus Shuttlesworth rather than an actor.  And even though Ray Allen isn't profoundly charismatic or anything, he very much comes off as authentic for the character.\n\nSpike Lee tells this story beautifully with commentary on life, freedom, basketball, parenthood and the father/son dynamic.  And I liked that ending.",

      "Review": "One of those 'concealing a secret with comedic effect' type of movies.  Staring Daniel Br√ºhl, as likable as I've ever seen him, the film balances serious themes with silly hijinks.  It's about politics, living in the past, moving on to the future and what we do for love.  We see Alex (Daniel Br√ºhl) go to extraordinary lengths to allow his mom to live in a world she felt comfortable in, or so he thinks.\n\nThe time period and setting is probably the most intriguing aspect.  It's interesting to consider what the fall of the Berlin Wall did to people in Germany on a granular level.  As an American I always assumed it was just a victory for freedom or some shit.  Although it was clearly a positive overall, it created a lot of complications for the country, and ironically, by concealing this Alex complicates it that much more.\n\nIt drags at times and feels unoriginal in moments, but it's a smooth watch, well made overall and gave me plenty to think about.",

Maybe they thought \"the fights are the best part of the first movie, let's just include more of that.\"  But they fail to connect most things or make me care about the stakes at any point.  \n\nThe acting ranges from laughable to just piss poor.  The filmmakers concept of humor is puzzling, it's like they half assed a first draft and just sent that in.  They included so many characters for such a short movie, which devalued everyone.\n\nIn some sense this is better than the first one because I was more entertained, but for all the wrong reasons.

      "Review": "A very clever way to explore the history of television.  Maybe the most interesting aspect of \"WandaVision\" is how it parodies the different eras of television so well.  With nods to all the TV shows we've enjoyed over the years, it makes sense that this is a TV show and not a movie, though it certainly feels like a movie throughout.\n\nOne thing that bothers me about TV in general is how it's structured in a way meant to keep you watching week to week.  That \"tune in next time\" schtick gets tired.  By the end, I was kind of expecting something epic to happen or some crazy development in the MCU to take place, and instead it just wraps up neatly.  Which is fine, but I feel that the structure of TV can often create unrealistic expectations.\n\nThe production value is awesome, it's filled with many clever ideas, great acting and expands on minor characters in the MCU for the better.  The CGI and VFX were amazing and the huge budget shows.  It certainly has me intrigued for the future of the MCU.",

We are sometimes dropped into the middle of a sequence without explanation, but that's okay, because we can figure out what's happening from the context and it aids the pacing.  It's also just so well shot, I was constantly taken aback by the look of the movie and the camerawork.\n\nAs is usually the case with Harry Potter, there's so many clever ideas thrown in and around the plot; like the time-turner - which I had forgot about by the time it came around.  The old characters are lovable and the new ones are intriguing.  Harry Potter is one of the biggest franchises ever, for good reason. \n\nThis is probably my favorite or second favorite in the series.",

      "Review": "A timeless tale about those guys who never left their hometown.  It's like they're all Ben Affleck in \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997).  This crew of dudes is a mix of flawed, unambitious and trapped young men.  Some are stuck in their position because of circumstances and their associates, other's are stuck because of bad decisions they perpetually make.   Regardless of their poor morals and continuing misjudgments, their friendship endures.  They're there for each other, for better or worse.  \n\nWhat made this movie so great is the realistic nature of the story.  All these characters feel so real.  The twists and turns of their story, however upsetting or frustrating, seem all too realistic.  The ending felt true to life, even if it's not what I may have hoped for.  On top of all that, Fellini's filmmaking is pristine and beautiful, and it carried the film that much farther, making this an absorbing viewing experience.\n\nMy first Fellini, and I'm looking forward to more.",

Last time I watched the extended cut (3 hr 22 min) which includes extended scenes, some which are just storyboards with voiceovers.  It made the movie which already feels long, so much longer.  This time I watched the theatrical cut, which is still a comedy epic at 2 hrs 43 mins.  I definitely recommend the theatrical cut over any other.\n\nThe cast is the most notable aspect of this motion picture.  There's so many famous comedians from the time and legendary cameos.  Buddy Hackett may have been the funniest person in the movie.  His facial expressions, timing and dopiness were continually entertaining.\n\nThere's also a lot of impressive stunt work, especially for the time.  Maybe a bit too much of it by the end, but you knew this movie had to have an epic conclusion.  It's just really fun.  And it inspired one of my favorite movies growing up, \"Rat Race\" (2001).\n\nIt's a comedy of errors, and consistently expresses that watching someone fall down is always going to be funny.",

Plus the dumb scenes Whedon added seem extra dumb now.\n\n\"Zack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League\" is so well paced, thematic, thoughtful, badass and still funny.  All those big epic moments, actually feel like they carry weight and are super impactful.  He does such a good job with mood setting, and it's so refreshing to see a story that takes its time and never feels rushed - all four hours of it.  \n\nAll those moments in the 2017 version that felt stupid, unneeded or just bad are recontextualized or simply removed this time around.  There were so many scenes that I scoffed at in the 2017 version, which just given the proper set up work so well.  \n\nThis is probably Zack Snyders best movie, and definitely the best DCEU movie.

I liked the editing as it jumped between the booming loud concert at Madison Square Garden and the quiet moments Murphy has alone or with select people.  \n\nI really do enjoy the music of LCD Soundsystem, not something I grew up with, but learned to appreciate later in life.  They sorta remind me of Talking Heads.  \n\nThe performances shown at the concert are pretty great and have a lot of energy and passion in them.  Though, I was disappointed to see half the film not be the concert.  Those moments of seeing Murphy off stage before and after the show may be cooler for someone who is obsessed with the band, but for me, I wish it leaned more into the concert itself.",

With methodical pacing and thematic imagery, this film rises above the low budget satire (which I love) Gregg Turkington had come to be known for.  Despite playing a character with bad taste in film for so long, we confirm what was long suspected, he actually has a great understanding of filmmaking.",

The film is an easy and enjoyable watch, with plenty of screwball humor and funny situations.  It also deals out a good deal of social commentary that does age well.  \n\nThe movie tells us that frequently circumstances can create a criminal or create a millionaire.  In life, I often times wonder how much nepotism and privilege allowed that rich successful person to become who they are.  And I often wonder how much someone's poor community and damaged upbringing forces them into a life of crime.  \"Trading Places\" takes this concept and showcases satirically how much circumstance allows a person to flourish or flounder.\n\nBeyond the social commentary, it's just a fun movie with great performances and laughs aplenty.  I can see how this is worthy of many rewatches.",

Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) spends the last days of his fathers life trying to understand what moments really happened to his Dad from the stories he was told.  And we learn sometimes the fantastical version of an event is simply more fun than what really happened.\n\nAt the very least it's a great caveat that your movie is about larger than life tales that don't always add up, because any logical problems are usually covered by that fact.\n\nIt's emotional but also beautiful in its message and in its visual aesthetics.  Tim Burton presents some gorgeous colorful shots in the flashbacks of Ed Blooms (Ewan McGregor) life.  In contrast, when we see Ed Bloom (Albert Finny) in the present, it is filmed in a more plain and bleak manner.  \n\nBy the end it all comes together in a wonderful way, it's kinda cheesy and sappy, but that's also kind of the point.",

The film is somewhat an allegory for the life of the protagonist Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) himself.  He starts off as a mysterious character, literally emerging from the woods nearly naked.  We slowly learn more about him as he  swims his way home through ten pools across the neighborhood, an interesting idea in itself.  \n\nIt's a unique film, with lots of artsy elements but still humanistic in most moments.  I was simultaneously sympathetic and suspicious of Ned.  Overall I enjoyed the vibes in this twisted suburban tale.

This was written by Derek Kolstad, who also wrote the John Wick Trilogy (2014-2019), which I loved so very much.  \"Nobody\" hits a lot of the same beats as those John Wick movies, maybe a few too many.  It starts to feel like a copy and paste job. It's so similar to those movies, I almost expected John Wick himself to show up in a post credit scene.  Nevertheless, that type of badass action works for me and made this film greatly enjoyable to watch.\n\nBob Odenkirk holds it down as Hutch Mansell in the lead role.  He gives us a character who is trying to stay on the up and up, but choosing violence is a constant temptation, that may win out at times.  I was also delighted to see RZA and Christopher Lloyd on the cast list as well.  Overall, very sequelable and I wouldn't mind seeing \"Nodody 2\" (202?).",

      "Review": "Somehow I had never seen a John Wayne movie, and I was excited to see him in one of his most acclaimed roles.  But I really couldn't connect with this film.  It seems like nothing happens despite how epic of a journey this is being presented as.  I can see the influence it had on film and all the Americana imagery is cool at times.  It was just uninteresting for long stretches.  The underlying racism and sexism of the time depicted didn't sit well with me either, even if the specific motivations of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) are justified.  Overall, it's well made and the story makes sense, but I never got invested.",

      "Review": "Actually pretty good.  It's definitely the best Mortal Kombat movie, and one of the best video game movies I can remember.  But if you know anything about video game movies or the Mortal Kombat film franchise... it's a low bar.  \n\nStill, this ended up being a lot of fun.  It's a movie that knows what it is and delivers what you're looking for.  Plenty of bloody kills, clever references to the video games, with decently good fight choreography.  It has enough of a story to connect all the fights in a natural way, and it doesn't linger too long on those gentle emotional moments you don't care about (in a movie like this).\n\nStill, it's a video game movie, it's relatively stupid and looks cheap in moments.  The acting is a bit of a mixed bag, but Josh Lawson as Kano was an unexpected highlight.  And the scenes with Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada) and Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) are actually great.  There's a handful of awesome moments, and this whole thing was a pleasant surprise.",

Mads Mikkelsen is astonishingly good in the lead role.  He is the life of this film, bringing energy and deep emotion to all his scenes.  By the end it has you thinking; alcohol, like life, provides a lot of big ups and downs, but it sure can be beautiful.  \n\n(And I'm okay with how cheesy that last sentence is).",

      "Review": "A profound and brilliant film, and the last one made by Andrei Tarkovsky.  The story is about life, death and (unsurprisingly) sacrifice, told metaphorically with the impending doom of nuclear holocaust.  Alexander (Erland Josephson) is not a religious man, until it seems he is facing the end of the world, and he then begins to bargain with God.  Much of the story is ambiguous and isn't fully explained, but I took it as partly showcasing how death is like the end of the world for the person who is experiencing it, and how they choose to face it speaks to that persons personal philosophy.\n\nThe movie is perfectly crafted.  It features some of the best cinematography I've ever seen on film.  Tarkovsky patiently paints every scene with deliberate movements and color pallets.  He's so good at giving life to the aesthetic of a shot when he wants, and purposefully withholding it when needed.  And the music, when it's there, deepens the experience that much more.\n\nThe film took me through a wealth of emotions, from pure dread and infinite sadness to sincere poetic wonderment of life and the human experience.  The dialog is incredible and touched on the deepest elements of existence.  And the entire cast is so damn good (notably Susan Fleetwood as Adelaide) that it makes all these emotional notes hit that much harder.  The super slow pacing is signature Tarkovsky, and that might not be for everyone, but personally, it only made me that much more absorbed in the world.  \n\nOne of the best films I've ever seen.",
